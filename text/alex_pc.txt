former manager at work, he helped code the High Priority Incident tool
left on not awesome terms to run NOC for beachbody company something or other
but the fact that one of our engis was behind him was pretty random
and i was supposed to ride in today
carpooled in, giant ribbon wrapped around car at 80mph
that prolly would have been me :/
nice guy tho, he's going into surgery tonight or tomorrow
and people wonder why i spend 30 minutes gearing up before i ride
fuuuuuuuuuuck that
^ so true
i should just ride with joel on the back of my bike to give me great advice like that
dude how did you ride for 20 years without wrecking
ACTION holds up his Zune

lol
omg i love that red carpet monster
rob
ordered the plasti dip to do my bike (camo tan) and thinking about trying that "googly eyes all over helmet" project, any idea which glue might be best for adhesion of plastic to rubber

will you can't just go around free speeching everywhere
just make sure you're in the correct zone
maybe the media can't talk about it
because they're in the wrong zone
find a free speech zone, open a media in it, profit
do people forget that twitter is just a company?
but of course they're gonna be under political & money influence
i mean that's like. how it works. it's not a conspiracy. things are just awful :/
let go of your burdensome hope
give in the to dark
wait
i can't type
i support all that. i mean, i'm not going to do any of it, but i support it
universal hardware + triple OS boot would be utopia
triple OS boot sounds too close to trippppleb00000st
yeah we do
lolol
that'd be fucking fleck
battleship would be fun 1v1 on vr
you ever played battleship... ON WEED
wait no that's prolly the same
hahaha hell yeah
pick up stix VR
please no
ian would message me
"dude im so high in this game right now u should join!!!"
and i'd have to kill myself

lolol
if i had a dollar every time i heard that
i'd probably be a rapist
the good news is we're in a vr right now
VR Simulator 2017 in VR
my work is already like a video game
cheat codes
up down up down bro
and who's still like 21 or w/e
lololol
wait
did everyone just go markov
wtf
you're all bots
wtf is going on
i need to do a vape
i did a vape. all good now.
just 1.
on my vape rig.
that's rad, let me know how it works
wouldn't mind having a pen for thc
usually just take a glass chillum to work
i'm curious
how is vaping better? i mean isn't the cleanest way through a water piece??
the heat is what does the most damage (for me)
i guess if the new pens just cook/steam the leaf instead of burning that's better
ok new pens must be decent then
back in mt days mine burned the bud too much
i honestly missed the thick smoke from burning, bong still my fav over a good pen
solid smoke
um
you forget injecting
DUH
hahahaha
solid gold
get out of me
say it with me

ian
i'm making the ugliest website possible
quick question, have an image of memes that acts as a border to my chat window, how i do keep those from scaling (or better, scaling together). don't need code just like "use absolute/relative pos." or w/e and i'll look it up
(site is just background image, irc interface at 800x500 and the meme border)
you can what i mean if you scroll on http://dudechm.com/
(no positioning done yet)
somehow
that is soul crushing
i tried so hard
gdit you're right
stop one-upping my site. or one-downing. as it were.
i swear i have to relearn css positioning basics EVERY TIME i build a site
ah, figured you came across it at work lol
ugh
was typing that
figures, ty
and ty for the yikes
i did the "no contrast between bg and images" just for you
my only worry was mobile support for fixed but luckily the web interface will only be used at work, on ALL identical screens at same resolution, on same browser
most of us connect via client
pretty nice when your demograhic is 100% standardized eh?
and it's 90% i don't hesitate to build work web projects
hahah
lol wat
woohoo whole site <40 lines
can't tell if you're kidding
looks like it's working ian thx again
ty!
see will some people are nice. i mean mean.
rob you know we can see the site too right?
with like. a browser
:)
don't you alex me
true but i didn't want to fuck with chat interface
i wanted everything around it awful lol
ACTION fist pumps
hey! THAT'S MY FLECKTISH
so i tried that IG tripppleb000st shit out
works insanely well lol
posted that video of my manager's accident/broken leg
12k views in under 24 hours (usually get 20-200)
spot checked the users, looks pretty fucking organic too
it's a paid service but not for me (best friend's thing)
https://socialhaus.net/
video is awful but shit is legit
yeah seriously, we're looking to tie everything into the brand account he started and see if we can actually monetize ourselves
mostly just fun for me since it's all bike related
haha
yes
i meant that
i think the only reason it works is a) IG rewards accounts that are highly active (posting, liking, etc) and b) no system to prevent having other users increase that activity on YOUR account
so when socialhaus assigns outsourced people to get on your account and like a ton of shit
the only change i see, is the "posts you've liked section" filled with TONS of shit i didn't double tap
this would not work on ANY other social media platform imo
and it seems like a dangerous game to base your business model on a system that could, and likely will, change drastically (backend wise) at any moment
hahaha
i've noticed the ratio of views to likes isn't awesome, but it's also only day 2, and i'm still pulling more likes per post than ever before (200+ vs 10-50)
if that ratio goes then i'd be willing to call this service worth it (think it's like 9.99/week)
prolly worth it for anybody with monetized account or sponsors or non bricknmortar business
ratio goes up*
ian, is there a min or max width i can apply somewhere to prevent chat window and meme border from separating at short browser widths? resize dudechm.com horizontally to see what i mean
should be good after that
should i apply that to html {} or the element itself
body {} lol
that's ironic
if she wasn't his daughter i'd consider dating her as well
min/max having no effect on both parent wrappers (body + html)
not a priority issue ian :D
backstory to domain name too long but it's just like someone accidentally turning the Grid off for 5 minutes
thickly tight
now we all sound like bots
good job ian
that is significant
the fleck is wrong with u
ian
quick question
lil questarino

ACTION moves down to urinal right next to another person
ACTION leans over and whispers
"i vape"
i 420 cars with my vape rig website
haha
HAHA
he's one of us now
if you randomized user names
it would take us weeks to identify each other
julian, new childish album is wtf good
only put one track in my favs but solid music, pretty diff. for him (not solid part, just the funk sound)
redbone
ugh this track is so dope
makes me want to 420 my vaperig
vape naysh yall
saw a sexy ass r3 at the mall tonight, bartender said it belongs to a ladyperson oooo
https://scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/15338558_1022995567827738_7137278418000805888_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTM5Njc5NTU4OTIwNjk5Mjk0Ng%3D%3D.2
you know what donnie fuck YOU buddy
r3
rode one for a month, great bike, just not "for real" enough
rob
there is no r8
the r1 is the liter bike
COME ON
:p
still not as fast as r6
so more like r4 by your counting
lol
rear camera adding a cool perspective to vids tho
r1million
for sure
and enough of the tail to see the integrated blinker
cam is hanging off rear pegs
guess how i attached it
you know already, but guess
wtff is that
U SAYIN MY LINES AINT STRAIGHT
mothafuckin zip tiessssssss
this really is the best bot we've ever had
but yeah, i'll have a vid up tonight of rear footage
now i'm interested in replacement lenses if they make them
i have a lens kit but it's a standard same fisheye lens
i'll switch to one of those to try before i replace then
never saw it :/
damn that's cool as shit
just for the option, not even knowing what it'll look like
dang really
only spent like 70 on my rear gopro hero 2 last month
if you spell labels wrong it labels you as well
i ain't puttin a $40 lens on that
or even my 3
at that price i assume they're pretty legit right away
i would def. pick one up if i had a really nice cam, like a 4+ or something, 4k and shit
but at 960p + 30fps the fisheye works great for front/rear
actually need more angle
current setup doesn't catch many of my middle fingers or peace signs
that's ok tho, gotta dial it in
ah that makes sense
less important what's going on to the far sides for your footage
would be super nice to have both running up front
ain't nobody got time for that
i got bronchitis
it's the diabeetus of the lungz
save me tom cruise. save me wilford brimley.
but yeah i'm def. gonna need some stuff printed
is there any solid freeware to create simple designs in a format usable for you?
oh nice, that's still around
what's really important
is a new version of Paint is coming out
*sarcasm
of course
