gtfo.
ahhhh.
yeah it's fairly useful.
i like it.
this morning i was halfway dressed and the phone was on the counter and i yelled "OK GOOGLE, WHATS THE WEATHER TODAY"
so i knew i had to dress for cold/rain.
lmao.
yeah, you dress differently for 30 degrees and rainy than 50 degrees and dry here.
yesterday i was feeding the dog on my way out the door and it was the last of his food, phone was in my pocket and i yeleld "OKAY GOOGLE, REMIND ME TO BUY DOG FOOD AT 12:30PM" and it did.
tight.
thanks donald.
tight.
LOL.
that was a good one.
good point. sea charts are charts too.
lol.
.. i live in ny.
hahaha.
basically.
vegas is attached to california int he map.
california was originally an island in old spanish maps.
https://www.raremaps.com/maps/medium/25522.jpg.
i love when old map makers didn't know somethign they just kinda like, made up a coastline, but it's obviously fake.
like "ehhh yep, up a little here… little squiggle at the top.. back down!"
hahahahaha.
that's so ugly.
hahahaha.
i wanna go to the premier and jsut be annoying.
talk through the film.
gasp.
"look out behind yoU!"
"hey what's the bad guy's name again?!!"
hahahaha.
nice.
start a JarJar chant, a la "quack" in the mighty ducks.
it doesn't look like a font.
yeah. hand-drawn.
it does use tons of amazing alternates and character sets though. italics, swashes, small-caps, ligatures...
did MT just decide to keep the 40% thing off forever?
LOL.
not on the site. just the facebook.
hahahahah.
so it's a "cyber monday deal.
that was """""""""extended""""""""" til tuesday.
and does'nt come down til wednesday.
makes perfect sense.
Cyber 2016.
lol.
lol.
literally anyone can be anything in marketing. all you ahve to do is ace one interview.
sad to say.
well the first "CMO" was just demian's life coach's wife...
hahahahaha will.
that's great.
unless you're a higher up, then all your friends get 6-figure jobs no questions asked.
even if they're still workign full time somewhere else and don't list MT on their linked in.
like Russ bringing in Albert, who """""""""""worked"""""""""""" there for 5 months and then quit by just not showing up one day but made off with $3mil cash.
yeah he had like, a percentage point of ownership in MT.
sold to godaddy.
then one day a few months later, just didn't show up anymore.
i mean i'm sure he told HR.
but no email, didn't tell any of us in engine.
just… wasn't there anymore.
lmao.
he did absolutely zero things as "CTO"
hahahaha.
that was fleck.
who had no stock and probably made no money.
and then sued us when he got fired.
ah i see.
lmao.
lol.
lol.
the current "Neal" guy at MT is another good example.
rod's friend, hired to be a VP with zero interview.
probably makeing 250k+.
was """""""""working""""""""" full time at MT but actually still working at his old job too.
and wouldn't put MT on his linkedin.
LMAO.
like he knows the first goddamn thing...
he came from Internet Brands Inc or some shit. looks like ebeneezer scrooge.
yeah, it's owned by GoDaddy's parent company.
they  moved President Rod from there to MT.
his introduction at the first all hands was 'yeah i, didn't really wanna come work here, but they made me.'.
yeah, he drove that nexus into the ground, there were all these articles from law people about how it used to be great and now it's worthless trash.
yup.
what a racket.
lmao.
you can endorse anyone for anything.
let's all endorse john fleck for power waddling.
lol.

chris has enough text to generate? and i don't??
(check the extra periods :/).
you can just replace "!." with "!", "?" with "?", then add ! and ? exceptions when inserting.. should be good.
should be tight.
DAMNIt.
haha.
lol.
so good.
HAHAHA.
it'snot regenerating though.
did you pull an ian? put the generating outside the class definition that gets called every time?
that's not tight.
DAMNIT.

sometimes it feels like everyone looks like me.

also is that guy wearing a cape?
weak.
yeah that looks pretty good.
not sure it'd be any better than digital ocean..
but still good.
obviously DECIMATING dreamhost/mt.
lmao.
to be fair.
MT should have been out of business 4 years ago.
so.
maybe this won't do it either.
lol.
LOL.
lol.
yeah rob's right.. when we were running user tests (behind a two-way mirror) and asking people to test our site out, we'd ask them which product appealed to them and almost a majority of them said "dv".. "why DV?".. "well, it's more expensive, so it's probably better."
i was sitting there stuffing my face with donuts like "HA!"
tight.
i talk more than you chumps.
that's the same thing it said last time.
i'm blaming this one on your buggy code.
wc -l ian.txt.
wc -l julian.txt.
let's see em.
lmao.
buggy code.
prognosis: negative.
PROGNOSIS NEGATIVE.
>my code works.
>julian edits it.
>stops working.
>blames me.
tight.
lol.
oh fleck.
tight.
these double-punctuations are runing the bot.
ruining*.
every ? and ! have a period after them.
markov.
lol.
yikes.
that got graphic.
LOL.
LOL.
it'll never die.
similar to how you never check your email.
instead of trolling for pornhub comments you should write that card game you invented.
oh yeah.
we have he weirdest bot triggers.
0 being the weirdest.
LOL.
so good.
julian's code is buggy.
solid.
lol.
fleck. solid. tight.
hahahaha.
what's that mean? severe weather warning?
well there was a 0 in it.
so it triggered markov.
which genereated a "wisdom of jason" by coincidence.
tight.
>julian's code.
>working.
pick uno mi amigos.
julian's definition of """"""""""""working"""""""""""" is "in production"
lol.
tight.
In OR Out.
In Burger, Out Burger.
i liked them before their merger.
i think in n out would do great here.
because every place has a line like in n outs back in LA.
starbucks, trader joes, shake shack.
they've all got longer lines than the hollywood In N Out on a saturday night.
lmao.
i went to the Tenement Museum the other day, which is this apartment building built in the late 1800s, neglected after the first war, then emptied in 1935 and completely sealed off for fifty years.
it basically had my current floor plan (my building was built in 1910).
actually it was a bit roomier because they didn't have bathrooms.
i was jealous.
hahahahahaha.
although it does make me feel slightly better knowing they had to haul all their water up six floors every day.
then haul their shit down.
shit being, literal feces.
at least i've got a sink and toilet.
they might be butt-up against each other but hey, they're there.
hahahaha yeah .. they did mention that as an option. illegal but, they definitely did it often.
apparently in 1910 they got one toilet per floor, which you shared with all 40+ inhabitants.
this explained what that strange tiny closet was for on each floor of my building.
what a nightmare.
hahahaha.
you're over here "hey guys, i got google fiber!"
rewind 100 years, "hey guys, we don't have to shit in front of each other anymore!"
what a time to be alive.
(until age 45 on average).
(assuming you make it past infancy).
(which you probably won't).
(RIP).

that's actually … probably a good idea. haha
what about gist.github.com
i'll let rob assure the quality of that code
hahaha
do you lose sleep at night wondering how to put the word "tax" into New York

its okay rob
we're here for u
hahahahahaha
Taxmania. sounds like a convention for accountants
& they play tonight
jules
hahahahahahah
i'm so sorry will
that was maybe the code i was least-proud of writing at MT
the "block VIPs from closing services"
but, there is a tool in hostops to let them close stuff on a case-by-case basis
jsut go to their profile and check "exempt from VIP RTC block" or something
i told everyone in VIP/sales and documented in confluence but then all of them quit and no one checks confluence
so it's lost to the ether
lol
back in Seattax?
(sorry, Seattle)

what are your plans for the numeral 3d printing
right on
lmk if you need anything
ah yes
that's important.. i'll think on that
interesting
tight
lol
fleck yeah
julian, bot idea:
keyword => bot grabs last three unique handles that posted in #realh3 => randomizes eight selections from those handles => for each selection, generates a marköv chain => posts in chat as "%name%: %message%"
it'll be like it simulates a conversation between three of us, in our own voices
lol
hahaha
oh i thought you said you wanted your job to be writing bots all day
nvm then. haha
lol
correction
we should run lex
based on our success with lyle

did you see fleck?

hm, interesting

alex, say tight
rob whats that neal guy's last name
at MT
Neal Uhhhh
not coming up on linkedin...
maybe he never gave his last name
since he still works at multiple other companies and isn't on our about page
oh
hahahahahah STILL won't put MT on his linkedin
what a fuckin dillhole
hahahahahahahah
jesus man, the gall of that guy
pretty funny though i have to admit
hahahahaha
hahahahah
and will
tight
lol
this bot really is starting to sound like us
creepy
pretty flecking creepy
huh, interesting
huh
what does it do?
behind the scenes
our chat corpus has to be enormous, it was like 5 years worth of chat
does this affect tight as well
cache one every hour
tight
sounds pretty good
text_model = markovify.NewlineText(text)
that line… if you can just cache that result somewhere, /tmp/cache
yeah
but that's the thing that slows it, right? probably not the make_sentence
hahah
well you don't need me to backseat program
you got this
you.got.it
you.g0t.it
hahahahah
man i hope when our bot becomes sentient and overpowers humanity it doesn't put us on trial for crimes against CPU
charge 1: reading an entire 100,000 line file into memory every time someone said "0"
charge 2: putting off writing the caching mechanism because you were lazy jack-offs
lol
wait.. you're seriously looking at reselling amazon's VPS?
on day, like, 2?

okay this sucks. haha
yeah i try to avoid reading the words he says IRL
haha
crimes against CPU
and the trump quotes are literal crimes against humanity
bush jr thought things like registering muslims and implementing a religious test to enter the country were vile and anti-american
great, now markov will be sending us ascii cats
LOL
fuuuuuck
@will, through my twitter feed, yeah
sounds like some fucked up shit
hahaha
i did, yes.
militarized police brutality on peaceful, legal protestors, protecting native american property from being developed and possibly ruined for an oil pipeline
i think you're probably fine as is
it's real bush jr. type shit
that is definitely flecked up
0
lol
yeah it looks brutal
there's a pretty good deal of coverage though, i have to say.
i would be pretty skeptical of twitter taking sides. especially against impassioned users (higher-value ad $$$ users)
i think that was mostly disinformation from trump supporters, who noted that slight misspellings in common hashtags (eg "#hillaryforprision") would skyrocket to trending
it was because the trending algorithm is complex and deals with relative bursts, not overall numbers
is my takeaway from it
not that i know 100% of course.
probably not too farfetched
i have a couple friends at FB
oh dude
ON it
joint rolling
nice jules.
lolol
hahah
wait, did you type that?
or was that a markov response
holy shit
while you were talking about editing its contents???
fuck
we made goddamn skynet
lolol
well
it is a game, but we're not the ones playing it
your genes are playing it. we're what they've come up with to win.
winning being, making more of themselves.

tight clouds
damnit
hahahahah
good lord i'm hungover
yeah. potts is in town. fuck.
yeah. that.
hahahahahahah
hahaha
that's a complete lie
i mean, the expensive part is true
"expensive, because you'll pay it for some reason"
lol
and you will fail because http://perlmonks.org/ still exists for some reason
oh alex, YIKES
but you're looking for "position: fixed"
np
yeah that is truly awful
thanks buddy, pisses me off for sure.
that's the dream
probably why i daydream about being an elevator programmer
hahah whoa
no need to bring my ex into this
lol
flecktishes
damn
that's insanity
did you do somethign special? what's the trippppllle boooo0ost in this context?
oh did you pay to promote it?
ahhh
that's one hell of a booooooost
lol
cool that worked. hope they aren't doing anything too shady
the only time i ever promoted anything i threw $50 at promoting that 'art of rolling' video
it sucked, got like 10k youtube views but all super 'low-value' hits… phone app plays from indonesia and shit
and that was directly through youtube. haha
i guess you can buy more expensive eyeballs but, fuck that, wasn't paying like $1.00/view
ahhhh
true
that's why SEO people are the worst
they have to sell bunk product every few weeks until they figure out the next way to trick google's robots
tight
jules
hahah
okay:
i'm gonna level up my markov app thing… probably start using the 1-5 levels you implemented
but i can't really afford failures
so
can you check for failure and jsut re-run on a lower level?
ah
and that's documented in the github readme?
ah, i probably can

thanx bro

it says something based on your history
if you say markov or 0, it says something based on total chat history
it was so accurate chris thought he said it
:(
one thing people say alot of in new york is "hey gang"
i don't think people in LA say that
because maybe someone in a real gang would hear it
and murder you
i guess
but why else would everyone in new york happily refer to everyone as a gang member
whereas no one in LA does that
hahahaha
greetings fellow gang members
to what shall we direct our attention to at this daily stand up meeting
that's how they talk
got that, thx
hahaha

and only old people talk like that
and they definitely do
i'm WOIKIN ova heeah
and den i says i says to da guy EY I'M WOIKIN OVA HEEEEEAH
all old people and poor people talk like that
it's pretty funny
lol
hahahahahahahah
?????
you've gotta be kidding me
every single marketing person in MT's history has spent at least 50% of their time trying to push all customers to yearly
well yeah we had been pushing back against that for years and years and years
the amount of salary MT spent arguing and planning and debating and implementing that was probably, no joke, $10+ million
and now they're rolling it back. ffs.

what did you need, again?
good overall dimensions are: assume the .svg canvasses i sent are the maximum height you said you could print.
honestly not sure on the screw hole placement. probably not ultra important at the moment
screw holes should probably be recessed (meaning, the screws could sit flush, or just below, the top edge)

joel just doesn't want to pay any taxes
lol
lol
and higher education basically IS free, at city colleges. and it WAS free at state colleges during the "yesteryears" joel wants back.
i'm just glad the liberal forefathers made high school free before people like joel could convince us all not to give lazy families "free rides"
most proposals on the table now are for free state college tuition
state colleges, where you have to be accepted, and can still flunk out. it's not a free ride. it is accepted students who work to better themselves.
and if they aren't 200k in debt, they are able to strengthen the economy, and use their degree to add value to their chosen job sector.
it's another example of a valuable public works program that always, ALWAYS, pays for itself inthe long run.. but anti-taxers try to kill in case they'r epaying for someone's "free ride"
i like the idea of free state colleges, personally
not private universities, of course.
yes.
i think the rest of the world sped past us. i think the average person of average income is better educated than 40 years ago.
and remember, it's older people who elected trump. the younger generation was smart enough to not vote for him.
yeah
and you're damn right people feel entitled to a college education, when they work their asses off to be accepted to a state college, maintain the necessary GPA to not flunk out, and then they owe $150k even though their grandparents went to state college for free (remember that?)
your'e damn right they feel entitled to that tiny portion of public funding, when corporate tax loopholes and evaders, like our "president elect", can avoid paying billions per year, because they bought and paid for every politician
hahah, that's true.
and i guess it's always been true and always will be true
lol
they're the only ones who would benefit from state college tuition relief
well, them, and the economy as a whole.
the state already decides what's worth learning, in a roundabout way—state colleges decide the curricula offered, and they have to be approved by the state government in some fashion.
with ya on that one buddy
heh
hahahah

good point, me
i didn't make good points in any of those three convos
but smash them all together
somehow, i made one
tinder was great
i'd give that app five stars
also in NYC tinder was basically an entirely different app. hahaha
if you ever want a vacation you'll never forget.. come to NY, you can stay at my place (i'll stay at my GF's), and just tinder every afternoon
my neighbors would think i'm a human trafficker with all the ladies you'd move through there
hahahahahah
fleckfest 2016 indeed
thought you wanted to be a developer!
right, i said wanted to be, not were already an old grizzled graybeard
i mean there's a real bed, for humans
ah, that's a shame
if you just like automating then i'd think QA is a better fit
dev ops do a lot of developing
at least, in my experience with them
lmao
writing new code
i've got plenty of small projects you can do will
lmao
greensbro
you name it, will. really want to reinstall my monitoring service on a non-mt server (so it isn't unusable)… got a couple of front-end projects on my github kicking around i don't have time to finish… would like to prototype out a storefront integration in case i want to sell stuff, like those 3D printed letters…
then, of course, there's the H3 work
yeah that'd be neat
would be great to have H3 backed up or packaged, have the bots consolidated and the commands documented, maybe rewrite the bot since it's probably a huge mess, move the datbase stuff to mongo or somethign else more stateless...
put all the code on github and give H3 commit rights, automate builds on pushes...

javascript has a native method for it
document.title
to test it, jsut open up inspector, go to console, and enter
document.title = "butts"
so if you have access to the code that fires when you click the search bar, jsut throw a new line in there, like
document.title = [whatever the site name variable is]
if you don't have access to that code, let me know and i can walk you through writing a chrome extension to do it

hahaha
let's see..
well i think all you really need is here; https://github.com/realh3
the `seanconnery` repo is just a python script
that connects to localhost's IRC server
and the #realh3 channel
(that's hardcoded in there)
then it looks for the scripts here:
SCRIPT_PATH = '/opt/sean/'
which is where the other repo in that link goes (seanconnery-scripts)
it'll open the config/sean.dat file and do all the listener setups itself
so basically you just tell the server to grab, and run, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/realh3/seanconnery/master/sean.py
and make sure that everything from the seanconnery-scripts repo is in /opt/sean first
and it'll spawn the bot and jump into #realh3
right jules?
that'd be siiiiiick shit
the one thing to watch out for is that we didn't want to put any of the boobs commands in there
so those are missing
and probably fine if they go away to be honest
99.9% of them are 404 or joel taking a dump anyway
last thing i need to do is see pics of joel talking about growing a tail
we should really migrate that to something less mysql-uy
mysql-esque
yeah that's just mysql with another name right?
i was thinking something flat or stateless, so we don't have to worry about servers and mysqldumps and shit
a nosql solution appeals to me. anything that stores data in flat files or json format or something
https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/
firebase is so perfect, i love it
it just gives you a RESTful api that returns all your data in json format
so, like, the python script can just HTTP.get(http://firebaseurl/seanconnery/quotes/random) and firebase will return "{ quote: 'go fuck yourself' }"
no need for SQL, keeping servers up, any of that
lolol
dreamhost remixer
what a crock of shit
they call each section of your site a "chord"
and you can "remix it", which.. well i'm still not sure what it does
breaks everything, for one
but probably other stuff too

there's just no way anyone who worked on this garbage is happy with it

mine was gone right after I left
it wasn't until my last team member, Erik K, left that they didn't update it anymore (I assume they didn't know how)
so he's still on there, even though he quit 6 months ago
yeah it's tricky business updating that page.. you have to remove the person's picture from the repo and it's removed automatically
real tough

vermont is on the list because it's on the way to montreal

so, Paris without the shitty parts
(sorry rob, Paris FRANCE)
HAHA
you're crazy. that place is rad, and i've never heard anyone say otherwise.
strange we'd have such different experiences in the same two places. also i've never heard anyone say ANYONE in Paris was nice
even people from Paris!
really?? huh, odd.

yeah, i'd be happier about it if it weren't full of naked old dudes who check me out through the frosted glass
eh. whatever. i'm basically an old dude myself, about time to let go and just walk around the locker room naked

so potts visited last weekend, it ruled

how much time do you think you save a week by riding instead of being stuck in a car
brapping around accidents and up to stoplights
so more than an hour a day probably
plus the random accident like today
makes me want to buy a "Motorcycle."

but back when i lived in LA
eh, scooter probably wins. can't bike on the sidewalks here and it's a surprisingly steep grade from downtown -> uptown
although.. parking...
but cyclists are treated like dogshit...
i dunno, you're fucked either way really
it's NY, if it were easy everyone would do it and then it would be hard
well yeah, anyone and everyone can just rent a citibike and then boom, they represent all cyclists
at least motorists need a license
so many tourists walk out of their hotels, see a citibike stand, "oh wow, how fortunate! a bike stand right outside our hotel!! we better take advantage and go on a pleasant ride" (not knowing they're literally on every corner and NY traffic is a hellscape of death)

like vaccines
you forget the smallpox

you aren't successful on tinder because you aren't following the Ian Method
what was her profile like
google that, see what it's from
what about her pics?
describe what she's doing in them

nice
tick tock, jules
Ian Method requires you to talk right away
you're running out of time here
psh
who cares
who cares
fine
then part of the Ian Method is that you can't tinder at work
since these "bosses" keep being annoying and getting in the way
noon meeting? barbarians
…
tell them if they don't let you tinder and chat in H3 during the meeting you'll "get a little jumpy"
then keep eyeing the window

nico holding a letter i designed by a german farm
Ergenzingen. it's a tiny village outside Stuttgart
spent a month there. so cool.
i think i agree with both of your assessments of england
ha
hahah
what is she doing in her pictures? and where was that quote about flying peacocks from?
good, good
okay
so, nothing really to go on
profile is a reference you don't get, all the pictures are her doing unremarkable things…
gotta say, unless you have a crazy thing for her, i'd move on
ah!! nice!
okay, boom. it's a little tenuous, but you can open with "hey!, how do you know [common connection guy]?"
nope, doens't matter. because then, however she answers, it's "oh, i work with him at amazon"
now she knws you have a job and you aren't a psycho
for girls this is a bit of rare and unexpected good news
then, jus tbe yourself. ask about her, and what she does and likes.
then make a date as soon as it isn't super creepy
do all of this right now before you can talk yourself out of it
srs
yes.
no more.
well, in the future, be more judicious with your right-swipes
depends on the girl.
LOL
hey girl, are you DNS? because i'm gonna have to wait 24-48 hours before getting ur address
(dont' use that jules)
so jules, keep at her until she's either cold-shouldered you twice, or you make a date.
2nd cold-shoulder, unmatch, start swipin' again
if you see her 'active' on Tinder again, that's a cold shoulder
i'd give it a day after that, max
and total, two days. tinder moves fast.
however she answers, bring up that you also work at amazon. this should initiate a conversation because it's literally a third of your entire life. and you sould be able to talk about it with normies at some level
yikes
that's pretty rare. or at least, it was for me.
gotta do double duty.
that's why you should only be swipin' one at a time
lol
that's why i never really tindered at work
even though i didn't have to do too much at MT
if you think chatting with your thumbs on your phone is a lot of work
whew, get ready for a first date
ah, that's good for you then. much cheaper that way. haha
for me, the intro was just chattin' away. the first dates, where i spent money, were the hard parts for me
"you should tell me more about that over coffee sometime"
is one that might work
lol
lolol
the latest Kanye digital download and a jamba juice?
if you have good chemistry with her you should try to make a date for tonight
hahahahaha
oh, here's another part i haven't mentioned
only swipe girls you're actually interested in. like, as a human being.
girls you WANT to hear talk about what they do
if you aren't actually saying to yourself, to julian naydichev, "man. i wonder what she's interested in." or "wow, i wonder what she does"
then swipe left my friend
it's tough to fake actually caring
lol
lmao
fleckl

.w Waymo
sigh
lol
rob pls
lol
that math doesn't add up...
haha
huh, that's an interesting question
he could probably design some low-level windows code that broke every windows machine at a certain date/time and bribe coders, QA people, and project managers to get it into the next windows update
he knows the code, knows everyone's boss involved, and has 100 billion dollars. i bet he could do it.
(rob, he could only afford to give like $500 to every person)
the internet, yeah. but not every cash register at every grocery store i've ever been to. haha
85 billion / 200 million =
four hundred twenty-five
it wouldn't crash everything, just enough to ruin local economies for a while
yeah. and in the meantime, just a few percentage points revenue dropped, a few payrolls missed, and like 50% of the population can't make rent
lol
jules
how'd your tinder date go last night
6 alarm fire?
destruction of london, 1666?
LOL
nice
.w The Great Fire of London
only one year after the great plague of london
ooh, nice
lol
haha
funny
haha, the original artist couldn't look up shit
aw, what happened?
it's an interesting fact that nearly all medieval depictions of historical characters show them wearing medieval clothing
like, jesus wearing english style tunics, moses wearing things with buttons
they actually didn't realize they used to dress differently, and had no real way to
yeah that looks more renaissance, which is when they started figuring that stuff out
so you still talking to the Tinder girl?
how'd it play out?
lol
fleck tahat
^
alter-ian makes alot of sense
hahahaha
need another list: wiki articles to read
"Wiki."
i started the american revolution!
it's short though
only 13 episodes
lol, scared of having to scroll through like four years of his podcasts to start downloading them
he did it for like 3+ years i think
yeah that's me
haha
that was a pretty awkward to record. i'm awful at voice over work
he.got.it
you.dont.got.it
not the same
gotta be "you dot got dot it"
for maximal trollage
you.got.it
much more satisfying
lol
"abo called me papi" hahahah

is that afghanistan?
yeah gee why wouldn't that war-torn islamic nation want to pimp its TLD out because it could be construed by americans as abbreivating "as fuck"
haha

wait, why aren't you renewing di.af?
don't you have junk.io

badass new free font alert
just found out some autist recreated Garamond
pretty fleckin' nice job too: https://union.io/images/repo/20161214-00--25eecb.png
download it here if you guys want it: https://github.com/CatharsisFonts/Cormorant
i see you guys care deeply about this. tight.
adobe had monopolized all the good Garamonds for ages
i mean, all the big foundries have one, but i hadn't seen a good free one in my life
and here it is. now you can just use it on a website or something.
good stuff.
🤔
this thread is killing me: https://twitter.com/Dropbox/status/809089934501945344
dropbox? no
oh, the font?
no.
just some autistic guy.
sorry, some "astrophysicist" who makes enormously complex, mature fonts "in his free time"
!aq "Diversity."
god, dropbox getting #ROASTED
countdown to deleting and/or apologizing....
hahaha
there might be diversity in gender… but generally you wanna have diversity in ethnicity, culture, and age (if you're going to just tweet "HEY CHECK OUT HOW DIVSERSE WE ARE," lol)
just a really, really dumb tweet
hahahahahahha
exactly, chris
fuuuck
brutal
haha
https://twitter.com/Dropbox/status/809089934501945344

h0stch0pper.com
i'm into it
i'm not particularly interested in trying to patch up the nmiller/toberlander shitstorm, or deal with either of them if they find out we're doing somethign without them,  but…
i'm sure it'll be fine
i dunno, tobers shot a music video for him and then there was some artistic/money/who knows dispute :ian!~ian@rrcs-24-136-125-138.nyc.biz.rr.com PRIVMSG #realh3 :HAHAH :Turd_Ferguson!~Adium@72.87.239.219 PRIVMSG #realh3 :im like a child that wanders into the room during the middle of the movie and asks whats happening
in any case they definitely hate each other. and they both would absolutely come around if hostchopper got off the ground again
nmiller more so, since he owns the domain and site
so we gotta provision for that eventuality
tobers not so much, i think he's busy being an actor
alex
pls
yeah
i owned the original one but let it expire after like 4 years of inactivity
at which point everyone, who hadn't mentioned it for four years, came out of the woodwork to yell at me
and nmiller bought that one
haha
yes, very assholish. also very dumb because that would just make him madder.
haha
yeah it wouldn't prevent having to deal with him
there jst doesn't need to be a conflict here
he'll be on board with it
uh
i'd advise against that
haha. we talked about it, we thought h0stch0pper was funnier
good point don
i don't think we need to risk splintering the brand any further. we should operate under the assumption we're all still in on this and not making preparations to cut anyone out
that'll just.. be weird
lol
i think we gotta rope nmiller in. tobers, i wouldn't reach out to.
great point don
lol
glad i added `{ helpful: true }` in the config
yeah, do some research, i'm interested
lol
alex
por favor

even though shared hosting is a bloated shitshow, i don't know a single good webhost
for just like, setting up a flat-file site
or deploying a flat site from github
setzen just looked around for a basic, barebones wordpress host, and couldn't find a good one. they're all bloated shitty whales.
DO is great
for a VPS
man, and seeing dreamhost's colossal website builder failure… there's gotta be space to swoop in there too
virb was amazing; they're currently gagging on their own vomit

remember the golden rule: no right-swipes until you know exactly what you'd say to them if they're a match
alex has reverted to caveman syntax
thanks bigfoot
good point
tight
you need technical rules for getting a date on tinder
the date itself, that's just what alex said in his yeti voice
LOL
but real tinder has strange intricacies and you're up against 40,000 guys who are 6'1+, believe me, you need to put in the effort
or don't and don't get laid, whatever you want man
i got no horse in this race. besides like, being a bro horse
hm, that was a weird way to say that
you know what i meant
or as alex woudl say, you know what me mean
hahahah
lolol
hey man, you're free to give jules advice as much as i am. he's free to choose which one of us to listen to, based on our tinder successes.
i spent as much time figuring out tinder as you did on your vape rig
lol
oh shit, he was still around?
he's been there forever
RIP
and the executives are entirely clueless
glad i left when i did
the two most addicting things in the world are heroin and a paycheck

who's his boss? let him go with dignity
he was on raph's "training team" at one point, watchign potts do all the work
then i think he moved to IT like a couple months ago

i'll take that
sorry pal

One of Donald Trump's advisers says the president-elect is no longer interested in his rallying cry "drain the swamp."
"I'm told he now just disclaims that. He now says it was cute, but he doesn't want to use it anymore," former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said in an interview that aired Wednesday on NPR.
lmao
same here
36 this morning, no wind
only wore a zip up hoodie
lovin' life
tight
congrats jules
when you get a chance i want the tinder deets!
hahahahaha
100% chance of mcmuffin
good shit
sometimes i think about getting more
but then like.. i just had to go to the bathroom REAL bad in a meeting
and then i think
ehhhh i could do without that searing pain for six hours
nice change notice chad
haha
doesn't sound like something joel would do
nice bro
keep em at home!
LOL
i'd definitely recommend against that raw part
lol
jokes on you, most clinics take a week to process the full blood panel
what's the date gonna be? drinks?
nice
considering you don't drink coffee
interesting choice
LOL
lolol
trying to remember if i ever had a date that didn't involve drinking…
first date*
adventure time was a dinner date
she brought weed. lol.
lol
that is correct, yes
starfished
that is correct. and she was a lead animator on adventure time.
i'm sure i've told this tinder tale a dozen times
TinderTale™
oh. well she busted out one of those things that look kinda like a wooden cigarette, with a recessed end, and you pack the end and can jsut puff a little for a while
yeah she was hot, she just wasn't all the way into it and got cold feet when it came down to it
alright.
AH, yes, consulting my map-o-first-dates, there was in fact one that didn't involve alcohol. and it worked out.
somehow.
LOL
yeah
hahaha alex that's.. just your life
@jules nope, she was cool
majority of girls i slept with were "first date" bangs. it generally wasn't going to happen if we didn't hit it off on the first date, and if we did hit it off, usually it happened right then.
but, there were one or two exceptions
where it was 3 dates or so.
i did meet my current gf that way.
LOL
she was a first-date 'heavy making out', but a 3rd date bang
i'm glad i didn't have a condom with me, might have fucked everything up
lol
i never lost respect for any of the girls. it was never sleazy.
i only had one one-nighter. and that was because i was visiting NY
all the other ones i dated
for at least, i dunno, 3+ months
lol
later
the work, building, relationship one
i still talk to all of them. they're really great people.
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
whoa will, weird
and yeah rob, still talk to her once in a while. she's rad.
LOL
power waddle
take the nearest innovation pipeline outta there

hahahaha
no. got a weird eye.
tight
hahahaha
where do you work
the "everyone is a troll" building
fresh off the boat
haha
yeah i was surprised how cheap it was
it was actually $6.50 on the menu, but the bartender only gave me $13 in change so I'm not sure if that was $.50 tax or he stiffed me
so I only tipped a dollar
just to be sure
I dunno… that starts breaking down in the $15-$20 a drink range
yeah
chris, are you saying you wouldn't pay $7 for the GUY FIERI EXPERIENCE
it's a visa to Flavortown
that's right; you need a visa to enter. it's a country, not a town, as its name might suggest
Flavortown is its capital. Flavortown, Flavortown.
yeah it was great
my visit to 420696969 Flavortown Rd, Flavortown, Flavortown. 696969
hahahahaha
that's acurrate
jules, I just had a PBR
I would have, but the bartender didn't crack my PBR for me, which was weird and illegal
but that meant he couldn't slip anything in, so I was pleased
well, I was more worried about bacon bits than roofies
lol
damnit
well it still tasted like the regular trash beer it is so, meh
the first thign on the menu is "GUY-talian NACHO EXPLOSION" and it's nachos with three types of meatballs, two cheeses, and donkey sauce + basil
NICE
saving to read
I did. feels accurate.
wow
@both that twitter video and that you witnessed the birth of the bloomin onion
oh yeah forgot to mention that part
Guy-talian Nachos. so good.
LOL
chris, went to a waffle house while driving through louisiana last week… and the grits were absolutely garbage
two questions:
how?
and
why
well that's my favorite type of food so I was pretty disappointed in the grits quality
also it was my girlfriend's first time having waffle house or grits in the south, so doubly disappointing
do you like eggs?
hey my font choice is tattooed on your arm
haha
baskerville, yeah
good capital W
W-affle house
hahahahaha
oh come on, it's not that bad
imagine if denny's menu was just the side-orders page of the denny's menu
and it was prepared by a guy smoking a cigarette
and served to you within 30 seconds of it being cooked
maybe you'd like the Casa de Waffle
although once my cousin ordered an omelete in alabama (before the anti-smoking laws were enacted by them city-liberals) and the guy makign his omelete was smoking and accidentally ashed directly into his omelete
my cousin was hungover and just thought, eh, whatever, and ate it anyway
and that's waffle house in a nutshell
hahahaha
so good
it's like what Denny's probably was 60 years ago
hahah, nice don.
but beware its retarded cousin, Huddle House
give 'er a whirl jules
you might like it
there are not.
no, I'd never recommend anyone go to a huddle house.
maybe H3's Vegas Vacation Yolo 2009 should include a four hour roadtrip to the nearest waffle house in Phoenix
lol
hahahahahaha
waffle house is so goddamn american
it is precisely what europe can't get right
absolutely everything. literally.
i'd make a list but then i'd spam H3 for twenty minutes
true.
oh, saw that a while ago. so good.
europe is no good at the restaurant chain model that WaHo thrives on. it can't truck in identical ingredients to places a thousand miles apart. it can't make exactly the same menu the exact same way like that.
it doesn't know how to do large parkign lots, bathrooms, and waiting areas. the lots for everything were drawn up 200 years ago so they don't have room for those big modern things.
it can't do coffee that isn't espresso. just cannot.
eggs are a baking ingredient there. they aren't refrigerated. they are sold next to flour. they don't know what over-medium or over-hard is.
they can't do maple syrup. it's just not a thing there. i got it once and it was served ina bowl with a spoon.
they can't do pancakes or waffles. once I got pancakes in london and it came out cold, with a single mushroom on top. (???)
their potatoes are, without exception, made into chips or patties. hash browns are foreign or unknown to most of them.
sodas and water have no ice there. water is not water, it's some seawater mineral shit served at room temperature.
the list goes on. but europe just isn't culturally capable of doing anything that waffle house does.
waffle house rules. hell yeah. makes me like america.
yeah, definitely. or, moreso than europe, anyway.
and waffle house's "culture" is in large part tied to the automobile and highway system. everything in europe was drawn up before those were invented really.
one time i went to an "american" diner in london and it purported to be a "detroit lions tavern", which meant the waitresses all wore baseball caps with the lions' logo on it. they did not have "filter coffee". the only bread they had was baguettes. this is europe in a nutshell.
^
that was precisely it
it was morning and i didn't feel like falafel for three meals ina row
haha
hahaha chris
more difficult there, but not impossible.
ah, found the """""""american""""""" place I ate at: http://www.edseasydiner.com/our-food/
dont' call it "Brekki", damnit
it's breakfast. goddamn.
so glad we revolted.
look at that hero image. they put ketchup and mustard all over the entire hotdog, including the bun
it's like they're doing a bad impression of america
you realize what that implies? they eat a hotdog with a fork an a knife.
animals.
perhaps they are trolling you.
fascinating read on egg refrigeration
also nice that the frenchman says he doesn't mind if his eggs have "poop on them"
and just """""""brushes it off"""""""
hahahahaha
hm, didn't realize that was the case
figured wheat was wheat.

muy interesante
liking where this is going
did you un-match her on tinder?
unmatching ensures you don't accidentally see that she's been active recently, and vice versa.
some people are really good with juggling those kidns of variables but i'm borderline autistic and it's vital I don't have access to that data. haha
lol
it's odd, and I can't really grasp it all, but even the fact that she can see julian ISN'T on tinder anymore is another important variable
@rob, you'd think so, but I found it's not always that simple. some girls are in a place where it's scarier that the guy is too serious. I don't get it.
that's why I always just unmatched, had a laugh, and that was that.
but eh, might not matter too much.
I'm not sure it's that simple. maybe it is, but there's a chance it isn't.
lol
yeah dating's tough. sounds lke your'e good to go though. hope it works out
yikes
I swear if H3 actually is giving good responsible advice and julian gets something great out of this.. it'll be a cold, cold day in hell
lol
I'm still reserving partial credit, for no justifiable reason

lol
what's she up to these days? same ol?

http://goo.gl/WwhwPE
it's not every day…
it was the line for the new subway station that opened
it had been 95 years in the making and it opened on sunday
yeah
it's about three blocks from me, we just so happened to be right there as it opened
so we went in, got on the first train that ever left that station
and were immediately delayed "due to train traffic ahead"
which makes absolutely zero sense
we were the first car in history
but somehow delayed due to a car in front of us. ???
yes, by a lot. I took it into work this morning, I felt like an actual human being
no shit, piss, vomit, rats, or garbage on the platforms yet
trains are wider, and ventilated
half the number of riders (only around 80% capacity)
it's good. very good.
lol
well the lexington line has accumulated it over the last 60 years
i assume it took at least 10 years to plateau at its current grime and stench levels
(hopefully)
lol
hahaha
oh I'm sure it'll be a living nightmare soon enough
but they did put in bathrooms, which is either "just crazy enough to work" or "really, unbelievably stupid"
but as far as I can tell, those are the only public bathrooms serving the entire upper east side, with maybe half a million residents
so, we'll see
it's in midtown. so about as far away as everything is from everything else in manhattan: 20 min on the subway
walked by it last month. it sucks. tons of cameras and people selling pro- and anti-trump stuff on card tables. total shitshow.
yup. total shitshow.
oh if I didn't already, thanks for the google photoscan tip Chris. uploaded my entire 2004 roadtrip and it fuckin rules
https://goo.gl/photos/e3FwbMagyAU2bYAE7 ahhh memories.
not as good as your 90s japan trip, which really documented a bygone age and place. but still fun

I think it was my last week at MT where that """marketing""" lady from Epson proposed MT become certified to handle gov't digital files so we could stop having real customers and just become a contracted middleman for the US gov't to store their shit on AWS

how else are you going to catch that you forgot to update your unit tests when you changed something in the actual code??
nice
weirdly, I don't really get DOMS in nyc. I'm not sure why, maybe all the walking up stairs?
well.. try a wider stance, then the DOMS will only be unbearable on your hamstrings
that's true for me a bit, but this was a pretty black-and-white drop off, even though I had taken a month+ off to move. it's probably the 20+ flights I climb a day carrying the dumb dog

not bad. up to 50 degrees today, hoodie weather
yeah. actually wasn't even mad at the weather in texas
80 degrees and humid
.weather
man, you're telling me
it's so nice
plus it doesn't smell in my apartment building hardly at all in the winter
since our trashcans are inside, it gets REAL bad in the summer
lol
why pick between paying thousands upon thousands of dollars for a dwelling, and living in a tiny closet?
PORQUE NO LOS DOS?!
lol
the more I think on it, the more I'm sure that the era your part of town was initially developed in is responsible for like 95% of your day-to-day quality of life
like I live in an early 1900s part of town, where the lots were drawn up for tiny people with no cars or need for parking, no electricity or running water, no alleys for trashcans because trash wasn't really a thing yet
when I was in houston the whole place reeks of post 1960s development.. highways and roads and lots are all ENORMOUS for automobiles.. nothing's close to anything
there's a sweet spot before the car but after public transport and running water.. yeah, 20s, 30s… just kinda nice
lol
tell em to knock it off
yeah bro
give in to your minimalist, practical dude side
live in a perfect bauhaus cube made of concrete

he's a fairly mean robot.
he says things generated from our logs everytime someone hits "0"

that does sound like me
… guess not
sorry markov, were we exploiting you?
oh, you're busy. I see.
go on back to the party then, don't mind us
it's honestly a combo
julian can log into it
but the 0s and markovs are real
hmm.. good point don. but how?
well… what do you have in mind? 10-day course?
yikes. yeah man, go ahead and skip that.
hope so
settle down Don
alex
https://twitter.com/GordyPls/status/816246348190126080 is this accurate (with the NOC instead of DC)
morning
spring in your step this AM?
birds chirpin?
not sure how to take that
how was the date, is what I'm asking
rad
fair, fair
did your sore throat come up?
nice
what'd you guys do? dinner?
oh damn, your place
did you goddamn vaccuum yesterday, julian
pls say yes
daaaaamn hahahah
jnads bringing it home. nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkIDCG6DouM
bored, jules?
lol
oh, rad
not for me. probably have to be an admin
shrug
yeah, high of 20 or so.
snow tonight & tomorrow
countdown to alex chiming in with how cold it was in LA (63/55)
oh shit, I was wrong, NY high is 32
gonna be a scorcher out there
barely legal
like, the concept of it? or the porn itself?
concept is gross yeah
like, who would look at a 22 year old and be like "not young enough!" ??
that's insane to me. haha
lol
lol
when I was on tinder it was strictly 25+
think I set the top to 32 or maybe even 33
probably didn't actually go on a date with anyone over 31
I set the age down to 24 for a few days; big mistake. it was a collage of group photos, selfies, sports bars…
noticed quite the drop-off
.t
seemed like everyone was "doing this as a joke!" or "my friends made this profile for me lol what crazy crazy friends i have" and them selecting the six pictures they thought they looked hottest in, regardless where it was or who they were with
after 25 years old you get more "here's a brief introduction to who I am and things I think are important"
but to be fair, I have no idea what they're dealing with on our end. most dudes probably have the stupidest profiles of all time
guess so
lol
lol
hahahahah
Yikes, Tennessee
don is on point this AM
don't forget refusal to vote
sup potts
lolol
there's also the MT disaster that is their new frontpage and associated video
it's incredible how bad that turned out
that voiceover sounds like a parody of a bad voiceover
lolol
that voiceover is so brutal
hahahahahahahah holy shit, I hadn't seen this before: https://vimeo.com/176359435
apparently I'm a hacker/
hahahahahaha
so weird
alex pls
lolol
lolol
I was the only one on the creative team happy to do it
everyone else was like "ehhhhh don't show my face"
I'm like fuck it, free tinder pics for me
and they usually catered
sign me WAY up
lol
when's the next date?
mine first
LOL
hahahaha
he lives in ideas
not in typing fast
LOL alex
rad jules
is she the one jason was obsessed with
hahaha yeah
someone shared it here I thought
LOL
hahahahahaha
that's amazon's solution??
so good
the solution is laugh at it and move on
haha
give us the lowlights
hahahaha
lol
well, you can't hope to censor the third party app's content… but you can sure as shit censor the words alexa SAYS
haha
like, rule one, don't say "fuck" out loud
haha
julian put this in the ticket: if (output.word === "dildo") { return false; }
there's the basic solution for ya
yw
weird
that's your constant state, really
wait, I want to hear where rob was going with his e*trade story
lol
LOL
goddamnit
ahhh
how MT doesn't shed like 20% of its workforce on every vesting date is a mystery to me
:/
uh, yeah it's held pretty stagnant in the mid-30s all year now
and you get to buy at.. what, like $17?
lol fat demian
right.
not at KKR Silverlake presents :P GoDaddy™ Incorporated
blake rides up: https://union.io/images/repo/20141015-00.jpg "pay me for your stock options. bye!" and rides off

it's at like 780
I'm noticing all of Will's political and personal ideas are now based on the Roman empire
yeah but if we put you in charge of planning a St Patrick's Day parade
pretty sure that'd turn out to be some kind of Ides of March version of what you just described
lol
!aq "Rome."
lolol
why does this make me laugh so hard https://twitter.com/KevinFarzad/status/790352446337929216
lol
hahahaha
new ticket to put a space by an asterisk
sounds efficient and a good use of everyone's time
oh, good to see nothing's changed
lol
how long can this possibly last?
I mean, how long can MT go on supporting a UX team in general
or any employees at all really
like, where's the bottom here
squabbling over asterisks while all of their sales are 3/200000 used
also I hear russ reeder is teaming up with brian kuhn and starting another venture, this time in Virginia, and he's trying to poach some MTers
like iCitizen, destined to fail
in some ways you have to give a big kudos to the american economy
for being able to support just so much bullshit and wasted revenue
lol
LOL
hahahahah
fuckin russ fuckin' reeder
huh, his linkedin says "previously" at icitizen
no current company though
lol
I think of the, I dunno, six or so people I liked enough over skype interviews to call them in for an in-person interview, about four of them turned out to be total windbags
just zero chance of doing the job, but they had it down over Skype and knew how to answer my prewritten questions
I'd get them in front of the group and then it was no bueno
jesus christ on a scooter
you've got to be joking me
keeeee-hrist
tell dolph
he's a cool cat, he'll listen
lolol
that's cool except for the tea part
and the holding out part
just shred bro, listening to Gygax right now
damn julian, never offered ME a job at amazon when I was looking
oh wait, did you? I think I applied… can't recall
LOL
hahahahaha
lol indeed.
0
oh wow, real MT stats
lol
lol rob's been keeping us up to date on that hilarious bug
blows my mind too because this wasn't even a weird part of the AC
not like React or Angular or API-driven or anything
just like, javascript. lol
lol
we put a man on the goddamn moon
what is going on
btw in case you missed it, someone digitized the code from the original lunar landing mission and uploaded it to github: https://github.com/chrislgarry/Apollo-11
hahahah hey man, I didn't do it
lol
hahahahahahahah
hahahah
no they sprayed febreeze everywhere and now it smells fine
and yeah
LOL
play as oddjob :wilbo!~Adium@c-73-37-79-114.hsd1.or.comcast.net PRIVMSG #realh3 :you hid in the bathroom on Facility with the Golden Gun didn't you?
oh yeah, that's a good one too
man we had so much fun playing goldeneye when potts came over
we literally got a pizza and played it
it was so fucking funny
hahaha
well it wouldn't be that ridiculous to invite them over to "get a pizza drink mountain dew and play goldeneye" as a throwback to being a teenager, joking about the pizza and mountain dew part
but we seriously did
hahahah
that sounds liek we played a pizza
guys we literally played a pizza
you live in pizzas, not DNS
hahah
lolol
lolol
so Igor is retarded
that's unfortunate
good that MT employs special needs americans though
...
special needs immigrants, even better
although it should be said
he gets credit for admitting what he doesn't know
way way too many managers would just go "… uh-huh"
and then further down the line you find out they had no idea the entire time
oh, right, definitely
hahahahah
I'm not saying he's even remotely fit for his position
but there were many MT managers nowhere near fit
and they just said "… uh huh" at everything they didn't understand :ian!~ian@rrcs-24-136-125-138.nyc.biz.rr.com PRIVMSG #realh3 :lol
I won't, you're right
when Matt Bell and I had that huge debate over the direction of the AC (using html/js vs using perl/template toolkit) he ended up going higher and higher up to try and get around me, finally reaching that GD guy Adam Lester (fat demian)
and that guy couldn't have known any less about anything we were talking about
but we sat in a room, dutifully, hashing out our arguments
and in the end he sided with me, and now we have a new AC
but if his mental coin flip had gone the other way
he would've just sided with Bell
oh he just picked one of us
probabyl whoever sounded more confident
yeah basically

wow I keep forgetting google has tracked every place I've ever been in the last 4 years https://union.io/images/repo/20170106-00--87db24.png
it even automatically organizes them into trips if it can tell I went somewhere cool
so fuckin cool
https://www.google.com/maps/timeline for those of you w Android
why
"Computers."?
you live in ideas,
not ports
you ride a motorcycle,
not a DNS
you don't fuck with nobody,
not a motherboard

hahahahahah
how much time and money are you willing to invest in this logo
must.. stop.. clicking
they aren't; it's not
I'm definitely not remote
alright
 really need to write that MNML script…
alex named my idea (images opening in a new tab at like 10% size and blurred out, and letting you progressively sharpen and expand it to make sure it isn't NSFW) "MNML"
lol
minimal, I guess
if you're already talking about points

I was wondering what I did for NYE the last few years, since off the top of my head I have no idea
bam, helped me remember Potts' sweet NYE party last year
and then our sweet Creedence cover band show the year before
fuck, I need to stop drinking so much
haha
hahah
oh yikes, nope
haha
true
the more I think about it, the more I'm convinced this "uptick in terrorism" is just that the crazies with violent mental health issues feel motivated to claim a tie to ISIS before doing what they were going to do anyway
since it turns out most of them never had any contact with any actual islamist group beforehand
oh yeah, then it's all about his mental state
few shades darker, and suddenly we start caring about his "motivation"

on windows, I don't really know of a good font viewer
if I were you I'd jsut go to https://fonts.google.com
they're all free, and it's a good preview tool
I'd jsut do that, then download it from https://github.com/google/fonts/tree/master/ofl when you pick one you like
also Moersen Font Consulting Co. is always open for business
(still working on the name)

jesus alex
throw an NSFW tag on that
(not safe for my work)
(this'd get me fired)
lol
exactly
these fonts are unfortunate
lol
hahahah
yeah man
also I'll be happy to help, but not with those sad fonts
hahaha
I'm not sure what you're designing Alex, but if you're looking for humanist 17th century distressed type, try https://try.typography.com/?font=100012
damn
what browser?
hahah potts
send that to annabel
alright thanks, I'll work on it. win10?
ah
k
I'll try to find an image…
(didn't test on win7)
what are you looking to design here, exactly
haha
you aren't really gonna find @ symbols in those free fonts
I'd jsut go with a 16th c. humanist serif and distress it slightly yourself
erm..
like, gonna draw a matching @ symbol in a vector software? or just hope like, times new roman looks good?
ahh
I'd advise you pick a font that comes with a @ already
instagram handle?
tellin' ya… you're doing the type equivalent of one of those ricer cars with a different colored spoiler, side skirt, and hood scoop
aight buddy, you do you
live your best life
lol. well, they wouldn't know it's a different font. they'd just know it looks amateur hour for some reason.
nice favicon
hahah
lol
damn son
