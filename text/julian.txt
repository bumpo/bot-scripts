yesh...
whatever.
made the same sentence twice :/.
but that's a good start.
good job chris.
toure really tight.
uhhhh.
okay.
well, gotta make sure markovify works that way.
we might have to switch to the new line reader, which is slower.
okay.
so.
as you type.
we are logging individual responses.
so when you type 'tight' it uses your corpus.
no.
we just have small corpuses.
so it's not making a log.
lot.
the fact that it's doing anything right now is amazing.
itll get better over time.
tight? tight.
other terms are the worst.
amirite?
 yeah, i'm flecking right.
anyway.
as we keep talking.
itll get better.
tight? tight.
tight.
solid is just a bunch of random bro stuff.
joel: do you vape weed? if yes, what product do you use?
tight.
ian, say tight.
what the hell.
you don't talk enough.
or with enough diversity.
oh yeah?
tight.

ugh. one second.

good point, alex.

you done flecked with the wrong engineer.
choo-choo motherfucker.
hahah.
bad mothafle-- shut your mouth. / i'm only talking' 'bout shariff!
>shariff as fleck.

my corpus is small too. but it's bigger than ian's.
which double punctuation?
who are we double penetrating?
lol.
narkov.
damn it.
markov.
woah.
uhhh.
you go ahead.
and write a script.
and i'll wire it up.
:|.
o u gaiyz.
this bot is great. i added some awesome features yesterday that none of you will care about.
mothaflecking donald drumpf.
oh?
lets corpus the shit out of that.
markov of wills book sounds interesting.
if that was like three replies.
it would've been awesome.
okay. flight is leaving.
peace iut.
go fleck yourselves.
haters.
tight.
haters gonna hate.
markov.
I feel like this is a lot slower.
markov.
:|.
correct, donald.
markov.
markov
haha
it'll do each unique trigger keyword once
call the bot with 'listCmds' to see a list of triggers
ight
tight
damn it donald.
morning
what does that even mean?
"max out your instagram activity" ?
and now you're an IG baller
why is yogurt so gross.
get out.
hahah
the timing on that
you left, ian showed up.
said you were gay
kind of fucked up, if you ask me.
but, I guess, that's just ian.
nice
fuck, I don't want to be at work.
;)
tight.
haha
it's markov bro
haha, I'd paste it on pastebin
but it's blocked here.
just login to will's server: /opt/sean/markov.py
yeah, we block pastebin
yeah
we have an internal paste thing
https://gist.github.com/anonymous/edfbba6eded11e08697c79e8ff82ee81
su pian
sup ian*
yeah
there's no state income tax here, brah
so, we're not really seataxle
hmmm
I can work on that this evening
I think I still have your number files (but may ask you to send those to me again)
I just gotta figure out how to make screw holes
hmmm
can you email me the svg files? with suggested dimensions? (in mm)
like, thickness => 5mm (or whatever)
approx height I should try to get the digit to be
and if you have any suggestions on where to put screw holes
maybe like a dot or something
I dunno
okay
we might be able to print a plug thing
so the screw hole would be recessed, and then covered up
but I don't really know how to do any of that yet
earrings?
I did that :D
I made new ones yesterday, but my right ear is hurting, so I didn't put 'em in yet
alex, look on thingiverse
there are plugs there, and you can design them a bit
or at least export them to tinkercad and do stuff
oh
ian
did I paste this? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/edfbba6eded11e08697c79e8ff82ee81
ah, I did
what the fleck?
aw fleck :{
^
yay
my corpus isn't too small anymore!
right donald?
right?
yofo?
what the fucking fleck.
lololol
this is fun
good job donald.
can my job be to just write bots all day?
I think that'd be flecking great.
y u mad tho?
I wasn't the jumper.
I flew.
mothaflecka
ian
sounds cool
write it
theres a way to mix markov chains too. we can do hybrid models.
me neither, donald
are you gonna pay me?
if yes, i'll do it
if no, maybe i'll still do it eventually
not idea
bot
integrate with twilio
so that !message actually texts someone
and if they reply, it messages the chat
chip chop chip, ian.

we should run a copy of donald
https://aws.amazon.com/lex/
lyle is super successful
nope
no
is he at amazon?
i forget, is fleck custom markov?
lol
lol
i just get distracted a lot
and adding a command that calls an existing script... i don't remember that as well
listCmds
fuck, forgot
he's just slow for markov things.
he didn't
that's the markov from your text
ih god
say fleck again
sup joel
ian, you say some weird shit
oh boy
youre flecking all over the place
the problem is with you.
fleck
fleck
oh poop
time to update the fleck script
MOTHERFUCKER
thick/solid/tight
oh
that's a good reference
show us what you got.
show us what y0u g0t
you wot, m8?
I'm going to try and clone the markov functionality to amazon's internal IRC :D
one day, will will be a great markov generator.
dude, ian1, whaddup
oh
guys
if you start typing under a new nick
it starts a new corpus
just fyi
that cape is flecking tight.
markov
so, the state_size parameter makes better sentences
I tried running it with 5 (which is supposedly creepy)
it didn't work
I don't think our corpus is large enough
but I changed it to 3
it just returns None
oh
I dunno?
*shrug(
when I ran it with 5 it didn't output
I could have it try a few times
yes'
tight and markov and 0 and fleck all call the same script.
two of them pass in your username, two do not.
adding tries and increasing state size makes it slow
we need a way to save a precomputed corpus.
well, I don't know how to cache it at all
but I changed state_size to 2
let's see how tight and flecking co0l it is.
not bad.
not bad at all
pretty flecking creepy.
fleck is this channels frak
ugh, too slow. :/
text_model = markovify.NewlineText(text, state_size=2)
is what we're doing
well, we'd have to serialize and deserialize the text_modle
I mean, I'm sure both of them are relatively slow
having it not read the entire file on disk everytime we say "fleck" or "tight" or "markov" would be better, yeah.
yeah, I'm trying to use h3 as a test bed
and then I'll drop a bot on amazon
like it ain't nobodies business.
no
haha
what is lightsail?
hater's gonna hate.
oh yeahhhh
I think I might abandon digitalocean for lightsail
but it's basically just managing an EC2 instance for you, I think
yeah
RIP ... what's that website

I don't know what happened
it stopped making things.
also, ian, re: ebooks from the other day. I'm looking for a specific book, it's not a novel. I guess it'd be "self-help" ?
what do you have?
also, fuck I really want to use this: https://api.whatdoestrumpthink.com/api/v1/quotes/random - but the ssl doesn't work on will's ve :-/

what's going on?
I'm ignorant of the goings on in the world. is the revolution starting? do I need to go buy some guns?
the flecking worst.
I changed the state_size to 3. I guess we're not ready for that level of sentience yet.
the interesting thing is that people are afraid of change, and yet we're changing nonetheless, and for the worse.
twitter is on the verge of shutting down, isn't it?
if the gov't said we'll pay you $x to hide this
I think they'd take it
'cause I'm sure $x => millions

I know a guy that works at FB up here, but I haven't seen him in a bit.
find out if this is true.
I'll do some effort on my end.
but that's awful
but why should we stand for that?
why is everyone just okay with it? where did this complacency come from?
man, I'm ashamed to be called a human.
I feel like those suggestions are fruitless
right
but that's the problem, I am but one man.

I don't know if `reverse` is a function or not
just make sure you return as soon as you have something
keep in mind also that it will take a while

I mean
I'm also waiting for a really hot, nerdy, smart girl that likes to go on bike rides and play board games.
to just magically appear in one of my guest bedrooms
you know what, not guest bedroms.
my bedrooms.
on craigslist?
"MAN SEEKS WOMAN WHO WILL SEX HIM"
I don't think I could afford "free" :x
I should do a meetup :-/
yeah
there are
but they're all outside my house
and it's dangerous out there for a nigga like me.
I agree that I'd rather get to know the person at least a little bit at first
but it's also easier to break it off if it is a complete rando
brb, picking up food
well
with my advanced ADD powers
I grow tired of women far faster than you mortal men
never!
I will not be swayed.
>will smith or facist
ian
I have a new game for you to make
will, if you're making people afraid, then you're not convincing them, are you?
"07:40:02            ian | knew it was either a fascist dictator or a will smith movie                                                                                                               │

I know that it's a block from my office
I knew vaguely about it for a while, my friend was working on it
there's a whole secret org about it
(that's not so secret anymore)
what else do you want to know?
alex,
contact customer service
they'll give you some free prime time
I know
but it wont hurt
and it will give you free prime instead of you paying for it
and maybe they can expedite another one or something
from working at mt, you should know that it _never_ hurts to ask customer service for something
especially when a company prides itself on their customer service
I think you're making the headache for yourself.
wtf is google express
what kinds of things are you ordering?
are they fulfilled by amazon?
^ same
chris: I'm not tied to amazon in anyway
other than working there
I'm not in the ecosystems
chris, more details
have you tried it?
is it amazing?
it's an hour to the nearest TB?
I'm stoned!
but it's not 4am.
1.5 hours?
I've never eaten at taco bell.

what kind of keyboard do you use?
ian: I'm wfh, email me the svgs for the #'s (julian@di.af) and I'll print them today
s/wfh/tfh/
(troll from home, kekkekekeke)
I'll see myself out.
nope
it just swings both ways.
okay, can you email me your address? or the address you'd like me to ship your keycap to?
so it's either sound or feedback?
gotcha
what's a das keyboard? the loud one?

thanks donald.
sorry, let me get a mint.

I like being involved. it means that if you ever make it rich, I'm in your posse. right? raight?
yeah, I realize how unlikely it is.
I mean....
I wish you great success?
https://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/5gu0kb/can_you_tell_the_difference_between_finnegans/
so this is what you're working on
YOUR SCORE: 5/7
ian: feedback, you should move the 'go again' button
otherwise A++++ would post again
haha
nerds.
close enough
that can't be true
someone must look like ebenianzer mcbattlefield-scrooge
chris, you sure you don't want the key cap ? https://imgur.com/a/ZKH1B
okie dokie. all mine then.
hmmm, wonder if i could sell those
how much would you pay for one?
how much?

ian, say more diverse things
spruce up that little corpus of yours.
very fnordy
not so much fnordxy
haha

yes you are
tight all the way to the market
i challenge will to write a novel that involves the gibberish that is spewed by donald bot 5000's flecking tight markov generation.
but make a story out of it
that can be followed
not just another book by ian and joyce
i guess that's true. who is the tighter story teller?
what the fleck happened, rob?
who needs to get paid?
nice corpus seed
chris, say tight.
if you pm the bot, yes
thats just bad parsing

welcome to...
carefully.
you must suck at spoons / forks.
you should keep a list
and have people vote on which you should actually watch
the results may surprise you
correct
yeah, I'd recommend a few things on your list
add silicon valley
at least just season 1
good man
houston vikings
>mfw
black mirror?
I think black mirror would be right up your alley
that's because it's great!
ian
make this a google doc
we'll schedule the next 20 years of your free time
just black mirror, no "the"
it's on there
click the link, will
lol
what
yeah
it's great
don't be a hater
one steaming hot cup of haterade, coming up
I think top of your priorities should be rick and morty
followed by black mirror and stranger things
and then do whatever you want
have fun with it
live a little
wanna see how thick, huge, solid you're gonna get from all this tv time
ian,  I watch 12 hours of tv a day.
and I'm only fat as hell
what's the harm?
I should really read.
dibs on secretary of the interior
also of the exterior
also
if ian got the job
it wouldn't be a presidency
it'd be a czarship
to the UN-UN-UNCE?
lol
I just want a chance to nuke n. korea
yeah man
I wanna be the secretary of the joints.
Secretary of 420.
NAT0
Ambassador to holla
holla-back girls.
ohhhh
can I be in charge of the space programm?
I'd like to go to mars before you blow up the earth
haha
Space Oakland?
:D
Spoakland....Spokane?
is spokane space oakland?
where everyone live's long and prospers.
what was the original topic?
we've gone off the rails here
"also all the LSD, and magic mushrooms and other substances that the DEA controlls"
that's not a solution
but it'd help
ultimately, we all need something like 'a young lady's primer' (vis-a-vis diamond age)
we need to fix the core curriculum
isnt' scandiniavia incredibly racist?
I think ultimately, joel's point is that our higher education is currently useless
putting people through it doesn't gain anything, it just wastes time
ian: no body wants to pay taxes
russia also has only 10 grades
"at 6th grade I learned I wasn't cut out for this high-tech corporate world. so I became a day-labrorer. I want to HomeDepot Institute for Day Laboring and now I sit outside and make pennies a day!"
chris, that depends. how many women have you studies?

it doesn't connect to anything at the moment
so I don't?
I did get the app

the haptic feedback is nice
if I pick it up and am waiting for it to warm up
it vibrates when ready
that's handy
I'll bt your wifi all night
I don' tknow man
I don't think there's a party mode like in the other pax's
so maybe it'll add that?
the primary appeal for me is that it can also do concentrates
yeah
the vape has a party mode

it's on alex's server
does it matter if it passes the test?
there are only two prominent female characters, summer and her mom.
they talk to each other, but about the famil
the rest of the family is male
so... probably not.
still well worth the watch.
it's a pretty good cartoon
futurama is also great
and you'd probably also really enjoy the smart humor in that
westworld is great
but there wont be a new season for two years
everyone is talking about it now because the finale just happened, but they'll forget about it in a fwe weeks
like everything else in pop culture
so, if you want to be a part of the conversation right now
sure, watch west world
but otherwise, there's no real rush
the only way west world stays relevant until 2018 is if they do a lot of viral/online marketing
it's still worth watching
and the season is over
so you have plenty of time
I just doubt that people are going to be constantly referring to it
outside of a few popculture references.
"oh dolores. you so cray."
it's cold here
it was 31 when I woke up
it's supposed to snow here this afternoon!
:D
I'm so excited.
I used "gone like tears in the rain" on a ticket at work because of you ian.
tons of people appreciate it.
no wait
because of you, will.
whoever did it.
yeah
I doubt it will actually snow
but I just really want it to
1 - 4"!
originally it was 1 - 6
it will very likely become freezing rain.
LA is easy: it'll be warm
and very likely wont rain
in seattle: odds are good that it will rain, and who fucking knows re: the temperature
ny: it'll be fucking gross, no matter what day of the year
tn: cold and dry
atl: humid and weird
vegas: slutty and hot
........yeah.

even our boy trump could do it.

!aq "bitch i don't know"
the switch is exactly what I want
mobile gaming
thatalso does tv gamging
I will! :D
I'm planning to play it on the bus to/from work
I hope the battery life is reasonable
and that it can at least charge via usb or something
controller != thing producing graphics
I want that screen to be hi-res
and that's gonna kill the battery
sure
but I'm concerned about the main console morethan the controllers
it would be great if they put massive batteries in the controllers and they share when they're all connected
I think the wii u handles the graphics for the gamepad too
so it's not really a good representation of what the switch will have
I don't think so... but I'm not entirely sure
if you have the upgraded battery, you get more
would you be okay with a 3DS doing 3 hours?
because I would not.
well, flights now have the usb things in most seats
at least the one sI've flown onm
so, as long as it can charge via USB
I'm happy there
5 hours, + usb charging
also, what are the games gonna be on?
definitely not optical. I wonder how large of an SD card I'll nmeed.
I would think a transatlantic flight would have USB standard
unless you're staying in the luggage bins ?
right
wii u does not do 1080p, right?
yeah, I'm fine with 720
we'll just have to wait for 1/12 to find out more
what are your bets on cost?
I bet $400
I imagine this is going to leverage downloadable things heavily
I really hope they make wii u v.c. stuff cross-compatible.
what's your bet then?
what?
I'd prefer $250
but I'm skeptical.
maybe they're testing those waters with the iOS thing
who knows what they're doing
and it's not that their hardware isn't decent
it's just what will said
they prioritize on the entire experience
rather than putting out 4k graphics that only people with expensive televisions can afford
can handle
lol

I don't understand what "work" is
maybe if you told it to me in nato form?
I think it's measured in newtons
it's a unit of force.
basically, ian is hitting or moving heavy things

there are some things that would probably break

there's no reason to get off in jersey.
just keep going south.
ian, I started printing the other 1
so by the time I get home, I'll have all the numbers
if I go get some screws, maybe I'll hang them this weekend and send you a picture
well ian
I'll tell you
now that you've left
.tell ian the 1 takes around 75 minutes or so, and the 9 took about 2 hours.
it's not ideal
but if most houses are ~4 numbers
that's about 4-6 hours, depending

he's actually looking to get a place that's walking distance from my house, so I'm hoping that goes through

well, yeah, anything's cooler than that.
I like that it's class-based, so I get to see the same faces and have some friends.

well, the US has practically been at war the entire time

what industries boom during war? I think it's time for some investments.
trump just knocked F-35 planes
and that stock took a dump
chocolate?
can I just horde it instead?
one FLECK load
hmmm, would war even bring about the change that we require? or would we all just end up destroying each other at this point?
u.s., russia, england
there's definitely a conflict brewing between the us and russia
especially with all of these election tampering allegations
but, my concern is that trump is in bed with russia, so if we don't do something know, that will be swept under the table in january
well, I think trump is going to make a lot of countries afraid :alex!~alex@192.229.234.2 PRIVMSG #realh3 :the whole south china sea is a political fucking mess

to answer your question from like an hour agoo
US, Russia, China
and maybe the UK
for WWIII
this conversation would be better with Joel.
he has the necessary level of trolling.
okay
so
the world is fucked?
the world is flecked.
joel
what are your thoughts on WWIII?
I am of the opinion that WWIII or a civil war are impending.
donald / trump / drumpf
killed.
I don't
I think the government has made it such that the people are eternelly complacent
and that it will require an external stimulus for us to change ourselves
or at least an extreme internal stimulus
so, trump would have to do something really fucking egregious, or china asks for their money back
the coasts vs. middle america, most likely
with the exception of florida
(the coasts - florida) vs. (middle america + florida)
yeah
maybe that's part of the problem

ittle bobby tables we call him
but that's worse :|
let me rephrase
I think if an american revolution were to happen, it will happen in the next four years
the next four years will either be an amazing economic boom for america, or an utter and complete disaster
I don't think we could have an economic boon and have it be a disaster
the success of a president is basically like measuring the GDP during his reign
well, not only
but that's a big factor that people care about
there's also the social change, and you're right, that would likely be a disaster
http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch2s23.html
we're supposed to rewrite the constitution

but that doesn't matter
they'll vote with the party
or get booted

I need aaron sorkin to write the dialogue though
I don't think trump could handle it.

unrelated, we need a name for a service that we want to create at work, originally it was "software deprecation service" (SDS) but people didn't like that
so I suggested, Automatic Package Expulsion Service (APES)
and that didn't seem to get any love either
my next suggestion is Package Modification Service (PMS)
obviously that one is a problem
SCREAMS => "Source Code Responsibility Enforcement and Management Service"
I'm either amazing at this or awful.
I'm going to assume awful.
got any suggestions?
haha, no :^}
it interfaces with Gated Garden'
(I didn't name either of those)
I think the management chain wanted a more uplifting sounding service.
Pruner and Shearer aren't it
Groundskeepr makes me think of willy
which could be an awesome mascot?

and in any case, it interfaces with GG, but that's not it's primary function

it definitely had the feel of a 'one-off' star wars movie

I'd give it a 6-7, my friend said 7-8
imdb has 8.9 or something
yeah, I think I've just gotten really jaded
the whole movie experience is really fucking awful
the movie was at 10:30
but probably didn't start until around 11
'cause of all the fucking commercials.

ian, do you like kevin smith?
he does a review of rogue one that is basically just one of the most passionate star wars fans recounting the events of the movie
so, if you wanna know what happens, but don't want to see it, you could watch that
well, it's in the comfort of your own home, you don't have to deal with mobs, ridiculous ticket prices, farting, and all that other bullshit

WWIII
and trump didn't have anything to do with it (Yet)
oh trust me, the US cares
aleppo was a big talking point during this election season
.w aleppo
there's a civil war going on in syria. US backed the rebels. Russia backed the Syrian state.
yeah
might not start, but certainly could be a precursor.
all I know is that shit is fucked.
and as long as shit is fucked, then it's gonna kind keep fucking itself.
until the point where it's overflecked. and then we're in WWIII territory. www.world-war-iii.iii
why not both?
I'm skeptical about a civil war, just because of the complaceny within the american people
yeah
man, all those paranoid people on street corners were right
well, depending on putin's involvement with our election, it doens't prove anything
however, I think if trumps election is legit, it just shows that the american people are afraid of what's coming
and honestly, I find that to be the fault of the american government
I need to get a firearm at home before trump is innagurated.
for my own safety.
I actually do wonder if there will be any assasination attempts
and if any of them will come from "within the house" so to speak
I kind of would be
just because of the amount of selection and scruitiny that is entailed with becoming secret service
sure
but I think we know a bit more about human psychology
and we have a lot more access into the deailings of their every day lives
yeah
they do if they want to survive
but not if they just want to make change for 'murica
all of this is assuming a lot
haha
that's a good point
I'd be surprised if it happened...
... pleasantly surprised.
but honestly, I don't really want to see the man dead, I just want to see him completely stripped of any power.
honestly, his death will probably cause more harm to this country than if he were just impeached / removed from power.
the other problem there is that a lot of people consider pence to be worse
so how far down the chain do we need to go before we get a competant leader?
eliminating trump just puts us into a worse state as pence leads us in the aftermath.
all of his choices have been awful
with the exception of elon musk.
he should've just put elon in charge of everything.
right
Vote Musk 2020
He's got the right musk to run this country.
well, he's not a natural citizen
he can't really be president, no

afternoon coffee on monday
irish roofies
meh, I get tea
mmm, tastes like roofalin.
6/3 - did date rape again
"a gentle lover, and caring rapist."
I imagine most girls need drinks to tolerate you.
I do not know this story
but that girl has a special plcae in my heart
also 'cause of the weed
I have somehow missed this story.
'went patrick'?
bateman?
ah
dafuq
I don't think I've seen it
gotta check my logs
I don't understand the star fish thing. was she a dude?
or just fugly?
cold feet? or cold teets?
eh? eh?
I'll see myself out
"worked out" => v(p) ?
was she fucked up otherwise?
well what happened?
and are these "went on first date and banged" or "went on first date and banged on 2,3,etc" ?
you didn't meet your current gf this way, right?
ah
was she a first-date bang?
ah-ha
follow-up
how many girls that you banged on the first date, did you respect afterwards?
@will: I'm not

I gotta go play with legos

merry pre-xmas lul
shaboya
utli
that's pretty tight
fucking shit
I left my phone on a bus
and I was tracking it on the find your phone thing
hoping the bus would swoop around and do the return trip of that route
but nope, it went to the fucking depot
and now I have to sit here until 10:30 to wait for the lost and found people to record my item
motherflecker
oh yeah
steam is getting a sale
having
steam has a sale and gets ddos'd
all the ddos packets say "where is hl3?"
they probably are
they're definitely not web scale
fleck those networks.
I've heard things about it.
but also, steam is down
fucking steam
thank you for seeing yourself out.
chargebacks are amazing
because they can't fight it!
ian, it was 22 when you worked out last night?
that's p. cold brah.
what news?
nooooo]
they can't arrest marijuana.
I need to smoke it!
also, ian, sopel I just cloned from github and launched on alex's server
not sure why it's poopan
marijuana was gonna come over?
why are you spreading fake news?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R795KiMD4zs
hi marijuana!
tell him I'll see him a little later today.
I'm going to smoke one or two of him.
until I'm green in the face.
yeah
https://github.com/sopel-irc/sopel
I don't think it's gonna break anything
it just wont work
easy peasy
^ use the pre-embargo stuff.
one smoky marijuana coming up
they're basically selling a vape, right?
this entire commercial, this guy is using weed and getting twerked
the comments talk about weed use
fweed
haha
2016
a fucked up place
well, we've been telling you to do that and you wont listen.
dear steam, stop being a dick so I can buy games I wont ever play. <3 j-nads
meh
I don't care who
just fix it
y'know?
fez
yeah
it's great
I wish there was a sequel
but the developers a fuckhead
ugh
I personally am annoyed by slack
and we'd have to rewrite the bots
point #3
so it's settled
fuck slack
we'll do it when we no longer have free irc hosting thanks to hodaddy
aka the pleb building?
will
are you okay?
.w Carrie fisher
she passed away today, I think.
I just heard
wanted to check on you
sorry dude
fuck 2016
her mother is still alive
just let her find it on the news

I'm guessing we have 20 years
tops.

has anyone played rimworld?
happy new year
HERPY DERPY DEW
HERPY DERPY DEW
morning
I am incredibly reluctant to return to work
also
dude
why would you go to a guy fieri anything?
I imagine that even a vegetarian option would be slathered in pig fat
^ what he said
that's a sale right thurrr
alex, I disagree. it's always $1/drink
if you're getting cocktails, sure
if you're getting beer, nah
oh
yeah
you want a good relationship with your regular bartenders
you want them tosee you and throw a beer in your face
why is everything so cheap it Hatlanta?
fleck that indeed.
wot
I just don't drink beer
'a $0 case of beer lasts me all year
did you enjoy your visit?
what did you order?
haha
did you check for pork fat?
no dude
the PBR they get comes from a different place
that already has pork fat in it.
Guy Fieri's PBR Pork Fat Extravaganzalicious
gross.
so gross.
haha
this reminds me of the time we went to outback and got a bloomin' onion.
haha, there's an open table thing on the page
and next to the restaurant it says "poor"
hahahaha
CRICKEY! A BLOOMIN' ONION!
I saw a waffle house in colorado
couldn't decide if I wanted to try it or not
I'm not a grits fan.
they're gross.
like ian's font choices.
yeah
fuuuuuuuuuuuuu
you're right.
I rescind my comment.
NO RAGRETS
hahahah
man
that's the best.
what is the one on my arm? Baskerville?
yeah
pretty appropriate
man, I really want some denny's now
and at the same time, I just threw up in my mouth.
... I mean :ian!~ian@rrcs-24-136-125-138.nyc.biz.rr.com PRIVMSG #realh3 :that's waffle house :julian!~julian@helium.naydichev.com PRIVMSG #realh3 :that's all I order :FnordX!~root@216.70.82.164 PRIVMSG #realh3 :I'd go to WaHo 100 times out of 100 rather than Denny's.
and that's basically what I expect
but how would you survive?
!aq but how would you survive?
!q
wow
I mean, honestly, it sounds amazing
I love most of that kind of food
I don't think there are any waffle houses in seattle.
unless you meant huddle house
and I don't know what the flying fuck that is
what the flying fleck*
.g huddle house
.w huddle house :HillaryClinton!~sopel@104.131.131.202 PRIVMSG #realh3 :[WIKIPEDIA] Huddle House | "Huddle House is an American chain of 24-hour diner-style restaurants with over 360 locations in 21 states, primarily found in the Southern United States. The chain was started in 1964 in Decatur, Georgia by John Sparks, with the goal of providing a 24-hour eatery. It is named after the act of huddling..." | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huddle
hahah
hahah
yes
Add Flavour! Add Fun!
like alex doesn't spam h3 with his 15 minute old posts?
mushroom?
was it a magic mushroom?
"have a nice trip, sir!"
part of it is that america as a whole is a "single culture" sort of
for sure
there's no way you're going to get different countries to agree
and they have thousands of years of culture to back what they're doing
america's got like ~300 years
of borrowing things from other places
well, and ian would have to eat vegetarian there
wheras the kebabs that I'm thinking of are tasty tasty chicken/beef
my parents call it brekki :|
but they're also from ukraine... so.... lol.
my parents?
probably
it would explain a lot
one thing that I find fascinating is how wheat is processed differently in the US and Europe
"""""apparently"""""" people with gluten sensitivities aren't as affected by things in europe
hahaha
nice
I mean, I did too
but I found out about that
and was fucking flabbergasted
in america, food is an industry
and everyone works to bring down the costs, at the expense of our health
but I feel like europe cares more about food for the sake of having a good, tasty meal
not necessarily trying to cycle through as many fleckwads in an hour by shoving food down their throats
and part of your love for things like waffle house comes from you being born and raised in 'murica
but frankly, I like the european model much better
alright
I don't not hate it
I just learned to ignore it
but I'll disable it
and actually, anyone can remove it
if you look at the source of sean, you can see how
fuck
FUCK
ian posted it to github somewhere
you don't need it
"/msg DonaldDrumpf rmCmd fuck"
"/msg DonladDrumpf listCmds" for a list of commands
yeah dude
I'm not gonna manually update and restart shit everytime
I'm fucking lazy!
it obviously ran
fucktwat.
fuck
oh
you
asshole
bitch i don't telepathically notify them i just can't ride it!
jesus christ you're all lazy.
I've probably definitely maybe mentioned it before
I know I definitely told you guys about listCmd
wanna bet?
that's for hillary
which I did not write
[fap2] [/opt/sean/text] # grep -R listCmd julian.txt
listCmds.
call the bot with 'listCmds' to see a list of triggers
listCmds
"/msg DonladDrumpf listCmds" for a list of commands
I know I definitely told you guys about listCmd
I don't know why I did -R
^ yeah
...
get the fleck outta here
I'm going to enable the fuck script again.
'cause I have to re-curse it.
!aq "i went to Guy Fieri's Flavor Town, who am I to criticize another man's life choices"
hahah
!q
thick. solid. tight.
if you do the 'listCmds' thing
you'll see the triggers
each can be run once per message
so, deez racist flecking morning jews are tight like millionaires
oh
ian
I have updates on tinder date
so, first date
we went to a chocolate coffee place "chocolati"
it went really well
second date, she wanted to see arrival
and then we had a good discussion about it and the difference from the short story (which she then sent me)
we were supposed to get together yesterday, but it was also her birthday, so she had to bail
but we're getting together tomorrow
I like her :(
no
I just ignored tinder
the only times I've opened the app was to show her picture to people
'cause people ask
ian: I get what you're saying
if she opened the app and saw that I was on
she might think that i'm playing the field
and not as serious about her or something
alex: next week? what do you mean
yeah, rob
agreed
but at the same time, if she's opening the app
she's either a) checking what I'm doing or b) looking for other people herself
if it's a), that's ... I don't know. I don't agree with it. but I can explain if she brings it up
if it's b) well, then I must not be that intersting and it wont last anyway
but ian
if the girl is scared you're too serious :julian!~julian@helium.naydichev.com PRIVMSG #realh3 :or wahtever
then it sounds like it wont work out either way
so what's the point of going through these hurdles?
I think it's two-sided
anything that you're afraid of triggering
she should be too
and if she's not, or if she's doing these other things
then it's a sign that either you're not compatible, or that she's a freak
s/freak/crazy/
I forgot about that feature! amazeballs!
yeah
sometime soon I hae to have the "what are you looking for" talk
"how srs is too srs?"
srs bsns girl.
and alex, re your earlier question - I told her about my weird food things
and she wants me to try fish and chips from this particular food truck
so we're going to go there, and conveniently, it's walking distance from my house
Tacoma is a legit option. Just a 40~ minute drive.
my weird food thing: up until like two years ago, I would eat a handful of foods, and nothing else. if you put something in front of me, I wouldn't try it.
that's why people make all the chicken nugget references
that was like my regular lunch at (mt)
I don't have nudes.
unless you want nudes of me.
^
it's full of gold coins
hahaha
spin my dredel baby, you might just get lucky
wink wink wink wink
and thanks ian. I also hope it works out. but I'm trying to keep myself free from expectations.
because that way lies madness.
both
I'm already thinking about her more than I probably should
^
yes.
:(
ian: if it helps, I'm ignoring most of your advice
she was a random swipe.
I'm okay with it
if anything, you fucks pushed me to try again
hahaha
new show "how I tried to convince your mother to marry me"
like, swingers?
or people looking for 3somes?
not really... there was an app for that
3nder
but I tihnk they got renamed
haha
hahaha
will, it's cool if you're a swinger
or if you just want to sit in a closet and watch
just looking for a 3rd?
tokyo drift that shit out of here.

@will :FnordX!~root@216.70.82.164 PRIVMSG #realh3 :Nope, but I'm finally caught up on all of the Marvel movies.
overall, yeah
!aq lol That's a porn company if he punches you first. And you verify through the power of christ unlocks you!
I liked that the end leads right into Ep IV
and overall, the plot was kind of contrived, but the production value was great, the robot was great
but yea,h I'm totally a hater.
haha
yeah
oh dude
when I saw Ip Man
I was so much more excited for the movie
I went in knowing as little as possible
yes.
going through life with as little information as possible.
ignorance is bliss.

hahah
motherfucking fuck.
I have a sore throat.
and a date tonight.
fucking fuck fuck.
sixteen?
how's your house doing, rob?
I don't get DOMS either
it's because your body is used to it, likely
if you took a break from lifting for a bit and went back to it, you'd get some DOMS
but if you're consistent for long enough, it goes away
(at least that is true for me)
it's a joke about who's calling.
DOMS ringin' at yo door
I tried one of the harmony remotes
and absolutely hated it
but I think that's because it doesn't work well with apple tv
god apple is the fucking worst
yeah, I don't know
the apple tv seemed cool
and I like it in general
but fucking shit
none of the apple products work with anything
well, the worst part of it
is that if you're a hobbyist and you want to use their homekit stuff
you're fucked
100% fucked
I __kind__ of get it
security in this field is super important
part of me wants to defend apple, alex.
part of me wants to shit all over their fucking face.
it's just getting to the point where it's making my life difficult
Wingston Arena, now open for Thrasho de Mayo
and Cinco de Chinko?
... too racist.
why didn't they succeed?
is it because they weren't targeted at consumers? did they not appeal enough to enterprise?
I feel like that should be illegal as a business practice.
but they just got away with it because they had enough money to throw at lawyers?
yeah
fucked up.
super fucked up.
goddamn it people. why are humans the worst?
interesting.
someone should make a man-in-the-apple-castle show about using BeOS instead of NeXT
and like, our world would be futuristic and amazing
instead of the shit-show drumpf ridden place that it is today.
I mean, yeah, without Jobs, Apple would've tanked
even with BeOS
and NeXT probably would've picked up somehow
or equally died
and then we'd just have windoze and unlux

so we did that, had a few beers
and then went back to my place

agreed
at this stage in my life, I don't need to see an 18 year old fucking
when I was closer to that age, I was more into it
men have a natural instinct to like young girls
I either read it or heard it on a podcast somewhere
I can't remember, or else I'd share my source
but we're biologically driven to procreate with a younger thing
rather, driven to want to procreate
I mean, will, "suitable breeding material" starts at like 12-13? for girls
and you'll be put in jail for watching that kind of porn
men in general like young women
the youngest we can legaly film is 18
and so the porn industry uses that to their advantage
it's creepy in a way
but hey, prostitution is illegal until you film it
then it's porn
and how the fuck does that make sense
right
which ones were those again?
wait, nvm.
don't need that.
people are into some really fucking weird shit
I think that's just the tip of the iceberg, wilbo baggins.
not at all
I've heard horror stories on tinder
like if you guys think we're all fucked up
you have no idea
we're all kings compared to some of the shit heads on the internets.
lol
nucking futty
nah man, he might believe his own lies
you'd be surprised how disconnected some people are
for example, check this shit out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7h7uevwxt8&t=140
will, you're doing better than a significant number of people
you're not a truck driver, you don't work in the food industry, you don't work at walmart
that's easily over 50% of 'murika
that mother fucking train kerning. I get you don. I get you.
I find that most people in life simply lack context
if you had a better picture of what everyone in your complex did
you'd feel a lot better about yourself
the end is semi-worth it.
yeah
it'sa bit hard to watch
basically, at the end, the guy is like, "can I get out today please"
and the judge is like, "fuck no. good bye."
@alex: the day you stopped holding yourself to unrealistic standards and accepted what you have
that's still pretty fucking baller.
holy fuck
who is your daddy and what does he do?
hahaha
400k sounds like either lawyer or medical
correct. not racist.
that'
s honestly the best
if you grow up with a silver spoon in your mouth
you're just fucked
and have a really skewed sense of the world
making that kind of money, you could buy a new porsche every year
what do you mean was?

I'm glad you turned it around, alex.

did you guys see the youtube vid of the kid getting alexa to say porn words?
so, I'm reading the internal ticket for it
and one of their suggested solutions was to ask spotify to remove it
yeah
https://open.spotify.com/track/3HP5qoaYi36Tcs8iljXld5
yeah...
man
this ticket is the best
there's lists of other songs with profanity and offensive words
so they're very quickly like, "yeah... that solution wont work"
I have no idea
I don't work on alexa
but based on what I've heard
I wouldn't be surprised if there a) wasn't one or b) it didn't work
apparently the _final_ resolution was to kill all the jews?
no, wait, it was to update the profanity filter.
you guys are completely on the ball for how software works.
alexa was saying the song name
where is this person?
I live there
seattle
yes. yes you should've!
rob, tell us of your electronic*trades
they're waiting for full-vestment.
is the stock worth anything?
oh, so it's not even RSU's it's options?
hahaha, lame.
at least when my stock vests at amazon, I don't have to pay for it.
I get 34 shares on my next vest date :|
.g AMZN
.c 34 * 780
.c 500 * (33-17)
why is godaddy so lame? why can't they just give you the shares?
ah
that sounds shady as fuck
I continue to be in shock that all of these seemingly illegal practices are still going on, and no one gives a flying fuck
yarp
can we include don in this purge?
but then we get pence
unless ^ rob
maybe russia will be kind and just nuke the whole thing
if we get rid of DC
we can start fresh
