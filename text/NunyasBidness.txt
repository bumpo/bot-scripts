morning.
you're right, i don't believe it.
hmmmm... nope.
not pay day.
but it is for you i guess.
oh ian...
morning.
and Chris ...
I figured out why i didn't think Google Assistant was that great at all, but you (Ian) thought it was awesome ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRoFErVvzM.
that level of integration is not available on Nexus 6P ... you get the voice activation stuff (Google Now), and Allo w/ keyboard interaction w/ Google Assistant.
as separate apps :\.
that don't interact w/ each other.
yeah.
but the fine folks at XDA have a guide on how to get that working on Nexus devices.
just need Android N, and the correct version of the Google app.
and a rooted phone.
not sure if i wanna go that far.
the Google Now voice app is plenty useful as is.
but i can see the integration w/ the assistant up'ing it's usefulness quite abit.
getting ready for work, "ok google, is it cold outside?"
lol.
alex you live in SoCal, you don't have weather.
alex, remember that day you forgot the seasons were changing and bitched to the channel about freezing your ass off on your ride into work?
G Ass could have saved your ass off.
hola will.
lol.
yeah.
english.
work from home ... english suffers.
yeah taht.
uh.
i tawk to peeplz.
but yeah, Google Now just gives me google searches for a lot of the commands that give you more useful (or otherwise easier to digest) information w/ G Ass.
like "ok google, find me some entertainment"
yeah g asssistant is too much typing... just calling it gass from now on.
heh.
you see that g ass chick? she fine! thick! like a bowl of oatmeal!
lol.
lol.
lol.
ian's maps shows California, NYC, and Germany w/ a vast void labelled "Here be sea monsters" in between the three.
by land bridge.
lol.
yeah... like the very early maps of FL http://rootsweb.ancestry.com/~fltttp/maps/1591.jpg.
uhhh... yup that's totally the shape it is.
getting closer! http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20130925/ARTICLE/130929505/AR/0/AR-130929505.jpg.

oh.
hmm.
active end is set to "Nov 30, 2016" ... so the code might still be active until tomorrow?
it's up to 90 now.
yeah that's what's happening...
basically whoever is in charge of managing Special Offers, doesn't know that active end date is inclusive of the date they set.
lol.

Spockland
shows ian MUST watch?
gotta agree... though, i think the emphasis on going to "college" rather than picking up a trade is a bit exagerated these days...
i guess joel touched on that w/ Rowe's point on skilled workers
skilled workers can make bank... granted it's by doing things with their hands usually rather than from behind a desk/computer

bob's scholarship of the mediocre
you must have a GPA of no more than 2.5 and no less than 1.9
i didn't get dumped.. but i'm on mt vpn?
"Everyone hates lawyers, double tuition for them"
"bob, you got a law degree and you're a senator now..."
"shut up"
i kind of like what TN is doing for higher education
free tuition for the first two years of college or vocational training
will
looks like that TN program is mostly Semester based
5 semesters ...
5 full-time semesters
so, fall, spring, summer, fall, spring
or 8 "semesters" for a school that does "quarters"
however, if you're enrolled full time it should take only "2 years" to complete...
they do allow for hardship exemptions to the "time limit" so the student can take a semester off to deal w/ whatever
more time allowed for service members (e.g. national guard or reserves activation)
looks like only for highschool grads enrolling full-time though
doesn't appear to cover part-time enrollment
joel, yeah, GI bill
though i don't know the exact details of the new GI Bill... just know that it can be a PITA in regards to paper work
I did Montgomery GI Bill in the mid-90s and it was basically enroll in college and get $800/mo if you're full-time some smaller amount if your part-time until you run out of funding
my cousin used the new GI Bill... i think it covered her tuition completely but she had way more paper work hoops to jump through
oh the TN program ... you must maintain 2.0 GPA, and do community service

but putting together a system that can push 4k @ 60hz isn't difficult nor is it expensive these days.  it's not like Nintendo is building their CPUs and graphics processors...granted, a system that can handle that might not have the "compact" packaging (relative to Sony and MS) that Nintendo seems to like shipping with
oh good

so .... a month or two ago, i wrote up a bug stating that the employee page needs to be updated ...
UX closed it w/ "we're going to redo that entire page soon.  We'll take care of the updates then"
earlier this week, "shit re-inventing the employee page is going to take too long.  Let's remove the people that don't work for MT anymore"
:\
it's almost like they're over there going "you can't tell us what to do!" "oh shit we need to do this"
yeah
they know how... they just didn't want to
oh
well... they needed to figure out how based on the babble in the sprint planning
isn't James Burke dead too?

morning
hola
i'm disappoint that gif had no jiggle to the jiggly poofs
i think will and i are the only ones still employeed at MT in here because everyone else is afraid of Jamf
GD's corporate spyware
yeah
i'm pretty sure that's why
yeah... same
or GD isn't watching as closely as people fear
but i guess that falls in to doesn't care
it's part of the amazon tron line of products
oh for sure.... thunderbird defaults to IRC over SSL when you setup IRC on it
lolol
i mean... i agree it's out of control... but does he need to state what everyone already knows on twitter of all things?

@alex: jeeps getting dents on rocks https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB3f-2JNdls

wonder if they'll get pissed off they didn't get any pie at the end and join the Axis powers for WWIV
@will: #ERB Gretzky vs Tony Hawk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goMYHB2Grvg
dunno... what was the last thing you saw will?  you see what i said about Japan and WWIV?

"We give you money! now you give us dick!!"
it's that thing the US does with China to get your vape components

lol
oh speaking of MT employeess....
https://www.evernote.com/l/ARe98wiDBAdIN7iBhBROYeyKSd-FAtyhTy0
wait... LA has a football team?
i thought it was a MT employee too :\
ah...
see
there
they didn't have one the entire time i lived out there
so... confused
lol
i mean it was the St Louis Rams for the previous 20 years ... so ... and i don't follow it close enough to know they moved back... i'm sure if i was living there i'd have known though
Los Yaryers
whoa there alex.... don't need to know that you do as a side job

Joel... that question w/ WWIII is relative to the Trump presidency...
fuck ... never gonna get used to saying/hearing that
World of War III
i don't think civil war is that close... i think there are too many people that are indifferent or just don't care either way
lol
oh yeah, we can visit there now
THANKS OBAMA!
see all kinds of 1950's american automobiles held together with comunist duct tape and bubble gum
it'll get worse after Trump get's his desired amount of Cuban cigars from them
not that that stopped him before
oh yeah ... for sure... he's appointed 3 goldman sacks(?) fucktards to his cabinet
sorry... 2 goldman execs
i'm fairly certain they did... the president isn't nearly as powerful as a lot of people seem to think
also even though the house has majority republicans, a large enough portion of those republicans don't like trump
isn't that what C-SPAN is?
weather is great
just happy it's above freezing again
i find that interesting... a bunch of deep seated conservatives were prepping during the obama administration
that would be a helluva parting gift
who cares?  you'll be enjoying yourself to the end

give 1M to every person living in the USA
giving everyone 1M would cause a chain reaction of inflation going through the roof, reducing the value of the dollar, and people thinking they don't have to work anymore .... it would reap havoc

not the best diversity... but better than some i've seen and worked for
there is age diversity in there too :P
yeah i agree it was a dumb tweet to call a "diversity" tweet... that's where their mistake was...
^ that
don't care about the race of who made it... if it's bad ass and works ... i want it
well, and i have a need for it
see
this dropbox post would have been a better diversity post https://twitter.com/Dropbox/status/805866559583358976
maybe their PR person mixed the 2 up
though, looks like the old white dude in the green shirt was photoshopped in
yeah, i used dropbox like once ... a long time ago ....

"Well, it has been nice working with you Lenny, but the time has come for us to part ways."
You’ve actually been holding us back for the last couple of years, so this probably doesn’t come as a complete surprise.
"Yes, “hostops” was our last Debian-Lenny server - note my use of the past tense there."

i kind of miss the island life, which was basically what it was like in Okinawa... that place was the poor Japanese person's Hawaii... place was great... would have been even better if i didn't have to dress in uniforms and get a hair cut every week... but getting paid to live there was well worth the experience imo
despite being climatic opposites?
and people not caring what they voted on election day? because it's usually decided before their elections are tallied...
same for Puerto Rico, yeah?
people forget that Puerto Rico is a US Territory all the time
oh man
dive shop in guam? that'd be chill i bet
"Porter Reeko"
puerto rico?
or guam?
i know i often see discussions on the internet on why Puerto Rico isn't a state yet
well i think it's more complicated than that... from what i've heard, the territory has to meet population requirements, and hten it needs to want to become a state, in the past the territory never voted itself to become a full fleged state
seems like the majority of the people there still don't want to become a state yet
also seems like the majority of Puerto Ricans that favor state hood don't live on the island anymore
hah... Death Star drone https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAez5OCFJVI

they don't need FTP ... they don't even know what that is!
"get rid of it! it's not making us money!"

hahah nice
maybe i should stop using my memorial pic for tinder
lol
i've expanded my range to include Memphis and Nashville
though
those areas are too far... most people in those areas don't want (or need to) travel 2.5 hrs into the sticks to find someone
still swiping ... i seem to have better luck w/ OKC, match, etc than tinder though
who did?
lol
wtf
lol
glutten for punishment
sounds like a bromantic comedy
curious... i got an extra 100 bucks this pay period... must have won it in the christmas raffle?
can't find a list of the winners anywhere though ... but it's exactly 100 after taxes... and not part of my normal check so that must be it?
"holiday bonus" ... if will doesn't have a bonus then confirmed  :P
yeah, this current pay check is in utli
lolol
hahah
good idea don, i'll get right on that
...
why
not like they don't know their sales generate insane amounts of web traffic
heh

"Not the Actual Events"
dude

yeah
also...
found a 10" touch screen headunit for my car

the pioneer is only 7"

herpies wtf
alex ordered one of these and just got it yesterday... best $23 i've spent on any of my HTPC's yet https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BB0ETW8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s03?ie=UTF8&psc=1
though... if i waited a bit I could have gotten the second generation version https://smile.amazon.com/Generation-Universal-Control-Receiver-Centers/dp/B01MS2V7GM/ref=sr_1_3?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1483293785&sr=1-3&keywords=flirc&refinements=p_89%3AFLIRC
more compact and sleeker design
looks more like a finished product
though it's so small that it tucks away and just blends in w/ the rest of the media center
how you liking the Echo Dot?
my sister got one from her work too
would have asked my sister about the dot but she's such a techno-neophyte... i had to help her figure out how to use her new MacBook Air and get her playlists to show up in iTunes... :\

Alex, copping the dank memes in 2017
that flirc device... with that connected to my Kodi box, i can stash the keyboard in the closet and control everything w/ my Harmony remote
it's the perfect finisher to a HTPC... super easy to setup and it effectively integrates the HTPC into a home theater ... none of the clunkiness of being forced to use a mouse and kb to watch movies

well... regarding egg, supposedly they're shelf stable for a month or two... so they don't really have to be refrigerated

got that asshole working fucking over time
well
i do have ssh warp access still via hostops... but like will
too lazy to figure it out
hahahah
didn't know about the /msg don commands
because you obviously want that shit to be recursive!
hell yeah
i mean
you never know if someone dropped some cursive in there that'll force you to get recursive on
you went to Flavor Town and only had a PBR... unless i missed something
bromosaurus rex
i think ian may be right on that one
i think it's more important for her to see or think you aren't continueing to look for others
particularly if you like her
true
yeah there's' that too
fucking too many variables
just do whatever julian
hahah

no echo pucks for Amazone employees?
seems like every other business out there is giving their employees Amazon echos
alex got an echo... my sister go an echo...
they're expecting you to buy one of these on your own https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CikgHaV7jE
lol
lol
but look how big that check is
that's the biggest check i've seen in a long time!
hahahah
i suffered the same problem last year(?), julian....
My Network > Connections
then search "plague against society"
lol
great ... working w/ women is great times... "Project Lipstick".... wish it were a reference to putting lipstick on a pig
...
lol
"Desert Shield" might as well have beend called "Project here's some sunscreen bitches!"
...
"operation wack some balls with some mallets!"
putluck?
hahahah
.w operation potluck
lol
yeah... they still haven't added any of the people that have been hired
just removed the people that have moved on to continue their professional growth
oh my
hmmm
wtf
"we don't need any of the other teams"
heh
"that's expected"
"HR needs to add the rest of the employees"
"powered by contentful cms"
no don i have no time for email
:\
did they use rapiers or cutlasses?
better yet https://www.weaponmasters.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/1200x1200/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/p/i/pirate_cutlass_sword_handle.jpg
nice
i've started watching Homeland from Showtime... about 1/2 though the first season and digging the show so far...
yeah
yes to both of you... claire danes and damian lewis... also Morena Baccarin
yeah... shows her boobs in it
Morena does
i don't think i've seen Claire's boobs
even though she's been in a few sex scenes
there are a couple of things about the show that bug me... but that's because I'm a Marine, and Damian is supposed to be playing a Marine
Morena was also in Stargate SG-1 the series
agreed
Morena? yeah, that's Damian's wife in Homeland
Deadpool's SO
don't think they were married in Deadpool
i think social media over hyped it becuase it was the firest Marvel IP to go for the "Hard R" rating
personally, i thoroughly enjoyed it
didn't bother reading reviews before watching it though
just knew i was going to watch it...
was the last movie i saw in a theater
the character or ryan reynolds?
lol
morning
hah ... Vikings behind the scenes pranks https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvgSZT2Nv6c
oh?
how much motherfucking did motherfucker fuck if motherfucker could fuck fuck
doing good
had family over between christmas and new year
was fun
it's winter so no yard care happening
started using the home gym last week
getting them DOMS in now
i really don't like when i over cook it on squats... the DOMS in quads is brutal
maybe?  i dunno
possibly... i haven't worked out since i got sick last winter
so i might as well have never worked out before i started getting back into it last week
hahahah
oh, told alex about this already... if any of you have a HTPC that you want to get rid of the keyboard for controlling Kodi/XBMC, get a FLIRC... I picked one up last week.  It's pretty sweet.  Combined with a Logitech Harmony remote, the HTPC just becomes a component of the AV stack that you control w/ the remote, no need to switch to a mouse & kb or switch remotes... best $23 i've put into my
HTPC yet
lol
and now it's all about proprietary this and proprietary that, and doing things different for the sake of being different
lol
why not do both
lol
good one hilary
that would have been cool
that was the one w/ the 64bit filesystem right?
lol
nah
needs more racism
http://toastytech.com/guis/b5pe.html
"Unfortunately Be ran in to problems competing with Microsoft, such as Microsoft's license agreements with OEMs that forbid them from selling computers that booted more than one OS. In 2001 after changing their focus to "internet appliances", Be went out of business."
heh
i dunno
without jobs apple was looking bleak
those jellybeans of the late 90's were a joke
BeOS on a 64-bit Alpha system
i remember wanting to get an Alpha system so bad
really?  all my win10 systems boot in under a minute... haven't bother timing it, but from a powered off state it's at the log in screen before the monitor is able to display anything... reboot w/ updates is another thing though
if it's not my lap top... seconds
ACTION shrugs
my Win10 PC is faster to useable from login than the MBP
lol
lol
oh yeah, i think most of my quick boot time can be credited to SSD.  I'm pretty sure BeOS was doing that on spinning media... so that's an amazing boot time
so 7200RPM IDE ... or 10000RPM SCSI?
oof... ATA33 HDDs
oh... ATA66 was available back then
but 7200 RPM wasn't "common" yet
it's always best to be safe, don
i heard about the bat bombs on "White Rabbit Project"
hahahah
nippon baby punk
lol
oh julian, regarding the house... power consumption on ~cold~ days had me worried for a bit
yeah, my house is on a heat pump for it's CHA... but when it gets down below 27F-32F it struggles to heat the house... it'd stay on for over an hour
my place is well insulated double pane windows all around... just heat pumps aren't efficient below freezing
i got one of those portable electric radiators that just gets hot (no built in fan) to try and help heat the place on the really cold days
no
couple times a year, and it usually melts within the week
i was looking at my power consumption on the power company's site, and noticed i used over 100KW on a really cold day (was 10F when i woke up), that sent me in to OMGWTF spiral... that was $11 of electricity that day... didn't want a $400 utilities bill at the end of the month
ended up being $183 (power and water) last month
well it freaked me out ... when i moved in (late summer early fall) the utilities bill was $135
never went over $140 until this most recent one
also, I sometimes think my utilities company is doping my bill to keep it $135 and higher.... had a month where electric was $66 but they claimed i used more water that month and so my bill stayed the same as the previous month
i cpuldf
wow
*i could
over all though, still totally enjoying being a home owner
just need to finish paying off my lowes card, and pay down my other CCs so i can start working on replacing the carpet, and installing hardwood and tile
yeah, that's what i'm doing on my lowes card... 0% until march... then it's all the interest back dated to the date of the purchase
i think i have maybe 2 more payments to get that finished off
yup
1 this month then next month and it's paid off
lowe's card
car paid off this past July
student loans paid off last Jan
$24.99?
cheap compared to BF1
hmmmm
are you "Jimquisition" on steam?

yup

step out to take a shit and this channel explodes w/ bath talk
hah
went to japan... where they still have bathhouses... people were like "you have to go!" "no... i don't"
and i never did
of course that might have changed if they were co-ed...
lol
hahahahahah
omg
lol
lol
talking about 20 hot dudes is what triggers the bot

oh well
back to being cold af in NY ian?
ugh... same'ish here... high 32 and snow predicted today
would rather have 32 over 20 though
wow
not really? but the title/name of the genre is creepy...
hah
never really thought about it like that... or really thought about it for that matter... but thinking about it like that does make it kinda gross
figured most of it is like movie acting anyway... "this teen just turned 18!" in reality she's a 28y.o. w/ 3 lbs of makeup and pony tails
shit... everything that rolls must burn!
same ... read/heard... .not sure which... something to do with potential fertility
nah ... they're barely suitable for breading at that aged... let alone breeding
yeah
unless you're in NV then it's legal in some counties
the ones right next to Cali?
that's there it's creepy... the pedo border
*where
i'm pretty much in the 25+ range too... well... closer to 28-30+ ... below that is just too much cultural difference... not to mention feels creepy for someone my age
"good lookin' daughter you have there!" "she's my gf"
though, see rich af 60+ dude's w/ 20 somethings all the time
lol
rofl
and the heff
lol

lol
lol
if there isn't there should be? but then  you're still at the discretion of the 3rd party services to appropriately flag their content
like in this case, if that "ringtone" wasn't flagged as not family friendly by Spotify it still would have gotten through
was alexa saying it or was it playing the audio file and it just sounded like alexa?
lol
lol
lol
oh
was looking at my etrade stuff lastnight
....

so amber... the new Ian... she's starting to scope people on their tickets lol
"this needs a  space between * and the words" "that's outside the scope of your original request. yOu need to open a new ticket to have it fixed"
and then we fix it anyway
gist of it was people were completely changing scope of the ticket mid process and she's tired of it, and now being a dick about making changes that weren't in the original request
i mean... not mid process... like when it got to UAT "it needs a whole other paged added!"
so the UX team is now on Sprints and scrum instead of kanban... so she can be super dick and be like
"we'll work it into our next sprint"
instead of creating some "flash sale" page to take advantage of GD killing elephants
ACTION shrugs
she's pretty stubborn... and catty at times it seems... so maybe she's just enough of a dick to make it stick
ah
yeah
that question
lol
hahahah
lol
hahahah
don is all in our datas!!
don is forever getting into our 0day datas
heh
yeah
they keep trying to fix it
but evertime someone tries they make it worse and have to go back to the drawing board
I think part of it might be the back end or whatever isn't passing the right variable information... the last attempt was the closest i've seen to correct, but when you set it to one of the settings, it would save nothing to the db... the db entry was blank for the FTP path... as if the user selected <user> as the setting
hahah
lol
After UX's last attempt to fix it... they talked to Jason Weaks on Grid team... Jason's response "Wait til UX-3701 is launched" ... Apparently Jason doesn't know that UX-3701 is dependant on the one trying to fix the fucking FTP user shit
lol
lol
