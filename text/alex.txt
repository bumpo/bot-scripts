good morning brocachos.
brochachos*.

julian how are you feeling.
i still can't believe the fall didn't kill you, glad to hear it tho.
http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/11/29/amazon-employee-survives-after-12-story-jump-from-top-of-company-hq/.
like i know what the fuck that is.
of course ian has an opinion on every website of all time.
the one time i don't link from jimmyr.
you mean all the stuff i disable on day 1 rob.
hard pass.
i just need the OS and a few normal apps.
i fucking hate all that shit.
swiping up kept loading that stupid google shit.
disabled the main google app.
i could see it being helpful if you live in a big city.
but i don't use my phone much.
....
this morning i woke up and realized it's fucking winter.
so i knew i had to dress for winter.
because of the winter.
you can tell from the way it's winter.
julian.
35 degrees outside.
riding a bike.
at 90mph.
it may get warm-ish during the day.
but it's fucking COLD at 4am.
i had 6 layers on up top.
3 pieces of headgear.
2 pairs of pants.
fucking brutalitarian.
that sounds like everyday rob.
wat.
"saved your ass off"
i uh. wat.
also what is g ass.
tomorrow i'll g ass on my way in to save my ass off.
at this point our bot is gaining on rob too.
:D.
oh.
g assistant.
right.
get your ass saved off.
ACTION points at lawyer, in cuffs.
i got about $0.00 i'm tryna spend.
haha.
will.
u fucking chart hater.
to be fair all of Ians maps are simple.
just shows California surround by sea dragons and mythical unnamed lands.
moving doesn't magically change your map.
OR DOES IT.
by the shea shore.
sheshells.
go dressed as JarJar.
get a t shirt that says "i pre-party with Romulan ale"
nb4 ian comments on map font.
which is actually pretty nice.
shit i just commented on font.
i'm neither fully grown NOR an adult.
i win.
wait no.
will.
i would much prefer a clingy ex gf than have to host at mt.
lolol.
yeah cuz all the people at mt have majors in their career.
wait no.
half of mgmt came from fast food.
if you can sell a wrench you can sell a ball.
hahaha.
it's mt.
drop your pants and you're in.
"i see you have no self respect. you're hired"
"i was like, working at hooters but like, now i'm like some CEO assistant!"
"power waddled in like he owned the place"
powerwaddling all the way to the bank.
no that's everyone now.
i have expanded waddling to all ex mters.
i regular waddled out twice.
but did not waddle to bank.
although godaddy sent me a letter about my 401k last week.
need to get notarized form at bank and roll it into my current 401k.
LOLOLOL.
prolly doesn't even know the second goddamn thing either.
amirite.

lolol.
wat.

y.
oh i thought you meant like real cars.
legal ass.
runs car forums. drives companies into ground. makes sense.
^.
speaking of which.
i'm an "engineer"
fucking LOL of all LOLs.
we should add ridiculous shit to our LinkedIns and endorse each other.
pres. of NOC here does that, has running joke with some of the dept. heads.
endorsing each other for nunchucks n shit.
so funny.
"you have been endorsed for Waddling by Rob V!"
"so i see your resume simply lists 'crushing it' for 2010-2013"
"i had a medical condition preventing me from crushing it in 2014"
"but i have resumed crushing it as of 2015"
we simply need proof. which is just you sayin you crushed it.
so yes.
ian crushing the housing market over here.
i mean julian.
well same thing.
hahahah.

man... fleck it.
linkedin is flecking hard.
BANK.
lololol.
ian/jules.
you have made h3 great again.
this is significant.
ugh i hate when you generate the outside of class definitions that you call. every time.
and other terms.
just to be ocd it's more just burning loose leaf than vaping.
in the interest of easier google searching :).
fucking hipsters.
just when i think you couldn't get any dumber.
you go and say something like that.
and TOTALLY REDEEM URSELF.

lol
"renting guest bedroom. free if your my gf"
i met all my current friends, and my closest friends to date out here, at bike meets
super down to earth, some couples, all just really great people, got their shit together etc etc
so you should try to hit events for shit your into, gotta be groups for some of that

wordemup

jesus this instagram tripppppleb0000st shit is retarded
last vid got 32k views and over 1k likes, i normally get like 100 views and 20 likes lol
this has got to be how people get sponsors and monetize their channel
little late for that
they'll rationalize their choice and not feel any regret
blame everyone else for how things are
"humans"
welcome to humans
awful, hateful things
to be fair
a person is stupid, and people are still stupid
yes reasoning with a person works all the time
and by all the time
i mean rarely
alternate realities confirmed
jesus fuck amazon fucking sucks
"your order is no longer in stock" WHY THE FUCK DID YOU LET ME ORDER IT
prime delivery "your order has been delayed" AFTER it's been confirmed to arrive today
about time to cancel my prime account
fuck that place, they fuck up 50% of my orders
let me guess
they're going to fuck it up
you'll put stuff in your bag and it won't recognize them, or won't charge your account when you leave, or fuck up the charged amount
that's not going to fix them notifying me about shit WAY past when they should
oh that shit you ordered 6 days ago that was supposed to ship in 2 days, that's out of stock. even though the product page listed it as avail.
so they can fuck that order up too
i'd rather pay more somewhere else and skip the headache
my account notifications say otherwise
fuck that, if you ordered as much as i do with 50% of orders fucked up, you'd be ready to drop the service like a rock too
prime
more like "prime example of bs"
WAT

"fucking shitty outside, guess we're not going out tonight!" said no new yorker ever
they can't wait to show off their H&M peacoat and hipster scarf
wearing nice ass uncomfortable shoes to literally walk around for like 10 mi.
horseradish
except i spent months in NY
ian maybe you've heard of "clothes that are warm and can be layered that aren't dress-up clothes"
and new yorkers constantly push each other out of the way
so just do that. while running.
"I'm in the Brute Squad"
"you ahh the Brute Squad"

crazy accident on 405 early this morning, traffic was non existent then boom, standstill for a mile
of course i brapped around it but there was like 20 emergency vehicles out there
oh man
let's see, 40min-1hr. car ride in morning = 25-35min. on bike
1.5 hours home in car = 45 min. on bike
so an hour a week in morning, 3 hours a week on way home
at least 4 hours a week
that's more or less included
but it's the equiv. of taking a half day on Fri. or something
or scooter or w/e (for NY)
but i mean, bicycle just as good as scooter in NY essentially
prolly better
hahahahaha
that sounds so true
to be fair
cyclists are fucking hoes
i'm talking about the everyday riders who think they own the streets
i'm like btich acting like that is MY JOB gtfo of here with your goddamn schwinn

go bag - a supplement to the operator's on-person gear
bug out bag - larger, multi-day packs, with a focus on food, water, shelter, fire starting and similar
bug-out makes sense
since that's what you're doing ;)
make your own variant
and just call it a gtfo bag
or a "fuckouttaheah!!" bag
julian you're a real go bag
i mean d bag
hahaha
iodine tablets. check. knives & compass, check
fine wine and cheeeeezes.
check
i support this go bag config
or get them drunk
and hit them with the bottle
hahahaha

it's not just mt
i'm a "network engineer"
which is pretty fucking lol
appropriate
nobody important
just a teenage witch
lololol
holy shit her?????
HAHAHAHAHA
taylor you sad fuck
omg
DONT TRUST THESE HOS
she's super hot
pretty much
who the fluff is that
don't think i knew her, unless she was that chick who xfered from front desk
wat
def. office hot ONLY
front door knocks off 5 points
hard pass
i see no deal makers either
she plain as fuck
and not in the hot way
hell yeah
it's fucking amazing
harder to find famous example
since plain isn't a hot ticket straight to hollywood
that's actually a solid example
^
she's good looking physically
in her leaked photos
she looks like a normal chick, in good shape without looking like she works out, and above average pretty
so, hot and approachable
essentially yes
i like chicks that look good (to me) w/o makeup
cuz i fucking hate makeup
plus the ones that don't wear much makeup usually have less self/body issues
so fucking true
except the british chick, she is fucking INSANE hot no matter what
she played Bruce Wayne's mom in most recent Batman
natural looking makeup, done well, is the best thing of all time
to be fair, Brita from community is super hot but she did the red carpet glam look in the show once
and i fell out of my chair
and then i fell off the floor
the Indian chick i'm on video Hangouts with right now is the best example of plain hot
ugh. gorgeous.
works out when you think your girl is stupid hot but no one else does
how u do that on mac
yeah this was a free mac air
i want everyone to ignore me and everyone i'm with
because i hate people
of course
i have never dated girls where that was a worry
if i can't trust you with my life than you can fuck on off
in surprising news, i've been single for 2 years
i'm like the energizer bunny
of not dating
i need to move back to GA and find a southern girl
hahahaha
ay girl i'm employed let me knife u
"omg i met this guy with a job last night, stabbed the fuck out of me"
hahaha brutal
julian doesn't like using tinder
puts ad in paper
ok
hahaha
such a terrible option for people like us
i'm going to step outside and do a vape about it
brb
keep in mind
if you follow ian's tinder rules
you'll still hate yourself
better than "i'm a peafly. let me cock"
actually no that is worse
ian spelled pecs wrong
:)
http://i.imgur.com/l6MOQFz.jpg
oh gdit will left
but anyway ^ that was my example of plain hot
crazy right? Amazon usually so good to it's employees

you ever fuck with those HID/LED bulbs with fan n such all built in
ordered a set of single beam H7 LEDs last night to upgrade the front end

just realized that
current janky setup http://i.imgur.com/EGqAaYH.jpg
5k LED on high beam, standard h7 on low
they're all essentially the same, just hoping i got ones with decent build quality
and i went with 35w, can't see how 55w is better or brighter
seems like 35w is just longer lifespan
that's why i go with ones that have solid returns/service
but at $30 a set, can't beat that
rain pls
pretty much
reminds me of the cagers who damn near drive off the road when i'm splitting lanes

https://youtu.be/mojJDe4ooEU
hi what can i get you?
how is the house mariganga?
yeah
to be fair, i bet that works great for adding smoke flavor to food
but it's just a traditional vaporizor
with what looks like SUPER high build quality
heating element. screen. tube.
smart to market towards food, opens both demos up without extra marketing :)
the venn diagram of "food" and "weed" is like 98% overlapped
wood
no wait
that's already a thing
hmmmm
i'm going to feel real stupid if i can boot up division through uplay w/o steam
considering i was pissed i had to put the uplay client on, or more accurately, STEAM installed uplay for me
gotta be kidding me
oy
it's fucking loading
steam down, uplay works. what world is this
connected through steam in offline mode, game still works
anddddd working
life basically just told me to stfu
i should have listened to h3
and shutted the fuck up
just finished packing a bowl of mariganga leaves
game is fun though. gave me copy of watchdogs 2 to chris, super glad i went with this title instead. solid "cover shooter" + loot game
think it's $25
watchdogs still like 40-45 on sale
^ sentient since you can't buy the game right now
only a few hours in but this is the best mix of shooter, rpg and loot game i've played since borderlands
just the right levels of each. good pve and, from what i hear, zone-specific pvp (which i'm not into)
wonder why i didn't hear more about this game, would be stupid fun with friends (think co-op is up to four players)
division
have to ask chris about watchdogs
for my play style it's super fun, my main concern was legit single player/survival mode
and ability to empty clips vs creep around
all there
how lucky did i get, bought last night before ddos, runs over network unaffected by ddos
jules i heard it was whatstheirname
phantom squad?
penis force?
something
same
why don't they just attack awful people/corps and let the fucking world rally behind them anyway
not video games you asses
you ever finish playing through, what's it, Pez?
Fez?
think it's like $3 right now
spetznaz?
haha ian i saw that on IG
to be fair she works in the "everyone is good looking" building on campus
so that's pretty standard content for them
well
yeah essentially
our building is NOC, hardware, winops, appsupport
other building is shit like marketing, sales, etc etc
rob those headlights came in early
look perfect
straight h7 plug in play
having that center eye light as LED and one headlight as halogen looked so fucking bad

wow that's cool, think i heard of that a few months back
damn that song is great
man
doing a coolant flush and pipe replacement (old one crushed in and a little bottlenecked))

i really need to hit that fastener shop up for standard fairing bolts and plastic washers
def. miss the naked FZR
oh god i hate those
luckily this shop has all kinds of shit like that
all sizes/types, dirt cheap
there's a couple old school web stores for shit like that

mornin chris
played any watchdogs yet? loving The Division, just picked up How 2 Survive 2 for $4
i HATE gta online
ok i hate everything online but still
The Division just has a central "pvp zone" you can simply not go into, solid single player
i know what you mean
hahah the hacking looked so rad
i prefer a "slightly" simpler gameplay (which is exactly what the division is)
but i saw footage of character running, car chasing him, and he just controls an oncoming car and slams them into each other, so awesome
ah, division a bit of the same
more cover than stealth but still
hahahaha that's gold
i've moved onto work slack

dollar a drink is legit
you can do $2 for the first one
i agree with that
but
you can up the first drink tip to make an impression if you want
this is for places you plan on going to
a lot
or often
some random spot 1/1 max
fuck that the way i drink they'll have $8 in tips from me either way
also why i don't go out, $12 case of beer lasts me 2-3 days
all i see is free beer there
craft beer. like blue moon.

i mean like, you guys have a spot planned for tomorrow or anything
dating is like a minefield. but more dangerous obviously
"follow these 270,000 tips for a perfect date!"
so you can fall and skin ur knee
and it will sting later in the shower
"how serious are you about being serious"
and regardless of how she answers
just respond with "seriously?"

she prolly saw how hot she looked in deadpool
and was like yeah i'ma get some roles
https://youtu.be/AtF6c4cCZUE
wait wat
deadpool was glorious
but a lot of that comes from how utterly contrived and cookie cutter and sometimes downright awful other superhero movies have been
even the ones i like are really not that good. Winter Soldier, most of the xmen movies, etc
so julians date likes the penis puppet and will is wrong about deadpool
got it
holy shit attack the block was star wars boy

bathouse

is that what you call what happens in the bathhouse?
"love"
ok
will would be like Ceasar
except getting stabbed wouldn't be with a knife
is that an assasination dagger in your tunic or are you just happy to see me
your totally straight bathhouse
shit would look like the cast of 300
but a porn
says the guy building a bathhouse
YAY GANG UP ON WILL
so gay but roman

a normal-sized bathroom done like a bathhouse would be pretty rad
but again, super rich shit

goooooood morning
hahahaha
raining but not too cold
will keep in mind that barely legal shit is biological
it's creepy as fuck to me but still
it was like fire. the wheel. young wives.
just sayin
is that a serious question
historically, human instinct is not "need to procreate, that 50 year old chick should work fine"
lol wat
rob, that reality is pretty spot on
but i still get where it comes from
but keep in mind
i'm talking about normal people who are attracted to all chicks like 16-60
but the reality of current society is just "most people are fucked up so instinct doesn't really account for it anymore"
^
the wheel/fire thing was just a ref. to "been like this since beginning of history" essentially
yeah barely legal is one of the less creepy things
but it's also a thin line
"i really dig 18-28" is pretty fucking normal
"i dig 15-17" throw that motherfucker in jail
i dig 30+ so i'm way out in the clear
essentially if you like "young 20-somethings" you're good
if you like teens you're prolly fucked up bad
i can't even talk to chicks in their 20s lol
and there we have it
real world data to back up my claims. write down the date and time
sad
to be fair i didn't grow up till my early 30s
and now i'm totally responsible
wait
no
no i'm not
yeah people getting attacked by zombies, ghosts
HAHAHAAHAHA
check out my cringe dump i mean profile
wait wat

not a concern
will add that in manually
christ
the more solid the better, will be printed in vinyl
wat
no, picking the best @ symbol from any of the 1000 fonts i have and use that
buddy works at vinyl shop, i'm just gonna shoot him a .psd or some shit
makes my life a lot easier, jsut need to get general design down
but 'broken' fonts would probably be a hassle sticker-wise
well, not really, all comes on a clear backing when applied but still
i dont need no ats
what ima do with an at
yeah but i like to use a standardized symbol for that
keep in mind people are going to see this
as it blows by them at 120mph
readiblity might help
